        "content": "Australian drivers are expected to know the road rules in their jurisdiction, but every now and then, a lesser-known law catches people off guard . Almost everyone’s been guilty of leaving their car unlocked for a quick dash into a shop or to grab a coffee — sometimes without even thinking about it. But in most parts of the country, leaving your car unsecured is actually a fineable offence . Speaking to Yahoo News, Sydney lawyer Avinash Singh branded the rule possibly the country's least known of all. \"This is perhaps the most obscure road rule,\" he said. \"Most drivers are completely unaware of it and are usually shocked when the police confront them and explain that they can be fined for leaving their windows and or doors unlocked.\" Why is it an offence to leave my car unlocked? While being lesser known, this rule exists to reduce the risk of car theft and break-ins. Leaving a car secured means doors and windows are both properly locked, to ensure it's not an easy target for opportunistic thieves. It also helps protect public safety, as stolen vehicles are often used in further crimes or dangerous driving. In some cases, if an unlocked car is stolen and causes damage, the owner could be partially liable. Overall, the law encourages drivers to take basic precautions and reinforces personal responsibility for securing their property. There is an exception to the rule, Singh, Principal Lawyer at Astor Legal , said. Drivers are allowed, in most cases, to leave a window open by up to two centimetres, which can offer minimal ventilation if, for example, a dog is inside. \"The legislation provides a defence if you have a window rolled down less than two centimetres,\" he said. \"If the window is rolled down any more than that, then you will be liable to be fined.\" He said he's personally heard of these cases being prosecuted in court. \"We have seen instances of police issuing fines for this offence. Reasonable police officers will sometimes issue a warning first, however, we have had people elect to go to court to challenge the fines,\" Singh said. \"The most common argument we see drivers making if they have been fined for leaving their windows or doors unlocked, is that the law is illogical and oppressive.\" Where do these laws exist in Australia? In New South Wales, drivers must lock their vehicle and secure the windows if they will be more than three metres away from an unoccupied car. The fine is $114, but if the case goes to court, penalties can reach up to $2,200. Queensland law makes it illegal to leave your car unlocked if you are more than three metres away. The maximum penalty is $3,096, with a $2,669 fine if the car is unlocked with the keys inside. Victoria requires drivers to lock their vehicle and secure the windows when leaving it and moving more than three metres away. The on-the-spot fine is $117, with court penalties approaching $600. In Western Australia, it’s an offence to leave a vehicle unlocked unless someone aged 16 or over remains inside. The maximum penalty is $50. Tasmania requires drivers to lock their car and secure windows when leaving it and moving more than three metres away, with a maximum penalty of just under $200. In the Australian Capital Territory, drivers must lock and secure their vehicle if they will be more than three metres away, unless a person aged 16 or older remains inside. South Australia explicitly exempts drivers from the requirement to lock their doors when leaving the vehicle. Do you have a story tip? Email: newsroomau@yahoonews.com .

        "description": "Yunus has thrown up too many balls in the air, and it remains to be seen if he is a wizard to pull it off, or n usurper who risks taking Bangladesh down with him",
        "content": "As India grapples with the aftermath of Operation Sindoor, a sordid drama is playing out next door. An unelected regime, backstopped by the military, Islamists, war criminals and revisionist ‘student revolutionaries’, wants to turn Bangladesh into another Pakistan – a jihadi hellhole, an economic basket case and a rentier state that dreams of breaking India and plans to suck on Chinese and American teats. This radical shift is being driven by Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel laureate heading an ‘interim government’ as the chief adviser. Yunus, a crafty, vengeful man, thinks he is playing 128D chess. He is writing blank cheques he cannot encash. It has been nine months that this illegitimate regime has been in power, nine turbulent months following Sheikh Hasina’s orchestrated ouster during which Yunus has overseen Bangladesh’s rapid economic descent, freeing of 1971 war criminals, a surge in Islamist radicalism, unhinged vendetta politics, hounding of Hindu minorities and sweeping foreign policy changes without the requisite democratic mandate. When he flew in from the United States to assume power in August last year, Yunus had promised to “restore Bangladesh’s democracy” through “free and fair elections”. He is ‘restoring democracy’ by banning Awami League, Bangladesh’s largest political party, one that is synonymous to the country’s independence, and by delaying elections. Not surprisingly, Yunus has run into a collision course with the BNP, the only major party left in Bangladesh’s political scene that fancies a return to power. The ‘chief adviser’, though, has other plans. For the head of a military-backed regime, Yunus has even made an enemy of the army chief because General Waker-Uz-Zaman has called for early elections and come out swinging against Yunus’s moves to take key decisions keeping the military in the dark, such as constructing a “humanitarian corridor” linking Chittagong to the restive Rakhine province in Myanmar where the military junta is fighting a civil war. Bangladesh is witnessing an intriguing power tussle and attempts at palace coup and counter coup. Yunus is evidently keen to control all the levers of power and enjoy unchallenged writ. His hunger for power shouldn’t have come as a surprise to Bangladesh watchers. US diplomatic cables leaked by Wikileaks reveal that the Americans knew at least since 2007 that Yunus possesses “a strong desire to jump into the maelstrom of Bangladeshi politics.” One cable, dated 13 February, mentions that “Yunus is considering entering Bangladesh politics” and that “he was reviewing his options”. The cable discloses that Americans felt Yunus is “a person of great moral stature and strong organizational skills,” and his “candidacy could offer a possible out from the present Sheikh Hasina-Khaleda Zia zero-sum game that cripples Bangladesh’s democratic process.” The Americans have always considered Yunus as “their man”, something India had a very good idea about. Another leaked cable marked “confidential” and dated December 2006, reveals what the South Block was thinking about the 2007 elections when the Americans wanted “neither Hasina, nor Zia to win” and were “actively supporting Yunus”, for whom the Americans had “fixed” the Nobel Prize. This dynamic between Yunus, whose status as America’s pet poodle has always been known, and the US, is key to understanding the great game unfolding in India’s neighbourhood. In his brief tenure, Yunus has already savaged Bangladesh’s close strategic, diplomatic and commercial ties with India, warmed up to Pakistan, hitched Dhaka’s boat to Beijing and kowtowed to the US. Much against the wishes of Bangladesh’s mainstream political class and even the military, Yunus is positioning Bangladesh as a mule for America’s proxy war against China in war-torn Myanmar – jettisoning the careful balance of power strategy that former prime minister Hasina used as a foundation to script Bangladesh’s rise. The worst part is Yunus’s authoritarian impulses and reckless steps are destabilising a region strategically sensitive for India, apart from making life difficult for ordinary Bangladeshis. In his effort to cling on to power, the scheming Yunus alternates between habitual India-bashing and divisive agendas to keep rivals off tack. In causing diplomatic friction with India, authoring wholesale pivot to China, and calling for a more robust American involvement in the region, Yunus is redrawing the strategic underpinnings of Bangladesh’s foreign policy, initiating transformative changes without Parliamentary backing or democratic buy-in when as the head of a caretaker government all he needs to do is ensure political, social and economic stability to ensure free, fair and inclusive elections. This fundamental mismatch between Yunus’s self-image as a ‘saviour’ of Bangladesh, his vaulting ambition, strong desire to wield power (refer to the US diplomatic cables) and the military and the BNP’s assumption of the chief adviser’s limited role, lies at the heart of Bangladesh’s ‘war like’ situation that Yunus blames India for. This turmoil couldn’t have come at a worse time. Bangladesh is struggling. Growth has stuttered to 3.97%, the slowest in 34 years. The economy is battered with industry shutdowns, high inflation, unemployment, falling wages and steep price rise, potentially putting millions at risk of falling into extreme poverty. Foreign investors are staying away. IANS quotes data from Bangladesh’s central bank to report that Dhaka’s flow of FDI fell to $104.33 million in the July-September quarter of 2024-25 fiscal, the lowest in six years, and the country received 71% less foreign investment year-on-year, down from $360.5 million in the July-September period of FY24. The flagship garment sector that plays a significant role in Bangladesh’s economy, contributes handsomely to the GDP and employment is besieged with problems. According to a report published last December, in one year “140 factories across various sectors have ceased operations, including 76 in garments, 50 in knitwear, and 14 in textiles. This has led to the loss of approximately 94,000 jobs, with the Beximco Group alone laying off around 40,000 workers from its 15 garment factories. In total, closures have left 134,000 workers unemployed amid the shuttering of 155 factories.” Trump’s punishing tariffs on Bangladesh resulting in a halt in orders from America and import restrictions from India have further hit the sector’s profitability. Things are so bad that General Waker, during the recent high-level gathering of military commanders at Dhaka Cantonment that generated a lot of media heat, reportedly said, “garment factories are shutting down one after another, and no one seems concerned. This silence is dangerous.” A clear barb at Yunus. The ’chief adviser’ remains unfazed. He is focused more on ideological agendas such as freeing hardcore war criminals like Jamaat-e-Islami leader ATM Azharul Islam, a death row convict accused of killing 1,256 people, abducting 17, and raping 13 women during the 1971 Liberation War, apart from torturing civilians and setting fire to hundreds of houses. Islam was handed a death sentence in 2014. The Appellate Division of Bangladesh’s top court upheld the death sentence five years later. Under the Yunus regime, the same Supreme Court on 27 May scrapped its earlier judgement – a first in history – that upheld the conviction and death sentence and ordered “immediate release” of Islam, a pointer to how Jamaat is holding the Yunus regime to ransom. In a measure of the distance Bangladesh has travelled under a vindictive, unelected regime, the Bangladesh Supreme Court led by its chief justice on Sunday ordered the Election Commission to restore the registration of Jamaat, the right-wing jihadi outfit that was banned by the Hasina government under anti-terrorism law for its role in violent protests and historical opposition to Bangladesh’s independence. Jamaat, that played a key role in the genocide of Hindus and Bengali-speaking Muslims during the 1971 war alongside the Pakistani army, will now be able to contest in future elections whereas former prime minister Hasina has been charged with “crimes against humanity”, and “the chief instigator behind the violent crackdown that unfolded during the July and August unrest.” It speaks volumes of Bangladesh’s trajectory under Yunus that the banned Awami League will not be allowed to contest elections while Yunus’s attack dogs, Jamaat and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir go about persecuting ethnic and religious minorities and altering the secular character of Bangladesh’s Constitution. In the zero-sum game of Bangladesh’s exclusionary politics, the pendulum will keep swinging from one extreme to the other. Yunus, who is crossing swords with the army chief and wants to replace him with a more pliant man, will soon figure out that he cannot run the country through palace intrigue, mob violence and revenge politics, and by seeking to decouple from India. Yunus is courting China on the one hand, giving it access to Lalmonirhat airfield, close to India’s Siliguri Corridor (Chicken’s Neck), giving Beijing opportunities to expand strategic influence through Teesta River management project in exchange for China’s help in making Bangladesh a manufacturing hub, on the other hand he is embarking on a risky pirouette by giving the US a route to back the Arakan Army rebels in Myanmar’s Rakhine state through the so-called “humanitarian corridor” that Bangladesh’s army chief went ballistic about. Since China is seen to be backing Myanmar’s military junta, the US sees a chance to lodger proxy war against the Chinese in Myanmar, and Yunus risks making Bangladesh a pawn to the great power game. Yunus has thrown up too many balls in the air, and it remains to be seen if he is a wizard to pull it off, or n usurper who risks taking Bangladesh down with him.",

        "content": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The final result of Poland's presidential election only became clear after a long, nail-gripping night of counting as both candidates were locked in a near dead heat in the first exit polls after voting ended. Poles awakened Monday to a clear albeit close result that returns a nationalist politician to the presidency who has pledged to hinder the centrist, pro-EU government for the remainder of its term. Here's what to know about Karol Nawrocki, Poland’s newly elected conservative president: Trump backed him Nawrocki is a 42-year-old historian who had no political experience prior to the campaign and who was not even a party member until he was tapped by the conservative Law and Justice party that governed Poland from 2015 to 2023. Nawrocki heads the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland. Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports. Nawrocki’s supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Many of them oppose abortion and LGBTQ+ visibility and say Nawrocki reflects the traditional values they grew up with. He was also the preferred favorite of U.S. President Donald Trump, with the American conservative group CPAC holding its first meeting in Poland last week during the campaign to give him a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised him and urged Poles to vote for him. His campaign echoed themes popular on the American right. A common refrain from his supporters is that Nawrocki will restore “normality,” as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags appeared at his rallies. Nawrocki performed better in the first round than expected, an indication he was underestimated in the polling. Nawrocki was linked to scandals Nawrocki's quick political rise has not been without controversy, with reports linking him to underworld figures whom he met while boxing or working as a hotel security guard in the past. Nawrocki has also been linked to a scandal involving the acquisition of a Gdansk apartment from an elderly pensioner named Jerzy. Allegations suggest Nawrocki promised to care for Jerzy in return but failed to fulfill the commitment, leading the man to end up in a publicly funded retirement home. His shifting explanations raised questions about his transparency and credibility. After the scandal erupted he donated the apartment to a charity. It recently emerged that Nawrocki took part in a 2009 Gdansk brawl involving about 140 rival soccer fans, some later convicted of crimes. Nawrocki described the fight as a form of “noble” combat. Polish media have also reported on his connections to gangsters and the world of prostitution. His critics say all of these things make him unfit to represent Poland as the head of state but many right-wing voters don’t believe the allegations and accuse the media of using its power to hurt him, creating what appears to be a rallying effect around him. It's unclear what effect, if any, these scandals had on the outcome of Sunday's result. The Associated Press",

        "content": "WARSAW: Nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki won Poland's presidential election , official results showed on Monday (Jun 2), in a major blow for the country's pro-EU government. The 42-year-old, an admirer of US President Donald Trump, scored 50.89 per cent of votes in Sunday's runoff, the national election commission said. His 53-year-old rival Rafal Trzaskowski, Warsaw's pro-EU mayor and an ally of the country's centrist government, won 49.11 per cent in the highly polarised NATO and EU nation. \"Congratulations to the winner!\" outgoing conservative President Andrzej Duda said on X. Duda, who had endorsed Nawrocki, thanked Poles for \"carrying out your civic duty\" and for the turnout, which was 71.63 per cent. The results followed a tense evening as both candidates had claimed victory when an exit poll indicated they were neck and neck. \"We will win and we will save Poland,\" Nawrocki told a crowd of supporters at his election night rally in Warsaw soon after polling stations closed. Nawrocki's win will block the government's progressive agenda for abortion and LGBTQ rights and could revive tensions with Brussels over rule of law issues. It could also undermine strong ties with neighbouring Ukraine as he is critical of Kyiv's EU and NATO accession plans and wants to cut benefits for Ukrainian refugees. Nawrocki visited the White House during his campaign and said he had been told by Trump: \"You will win.\" US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem also endorsed Nawrocki when she attended a conservative conference in Poland last week, saying: \"He needs to be the next president.\" \"CATHOLIC VALUES\" Polish presidents have some influence over foreign and defence policy and wield veto power over legislation, which can only be overturned by a three-fifths majority in parliament, which the government does not have. Reforms planned by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a former European Council president who came to power in 2023, have been held up by a deadlock with the current president. Many Nawrocki supporters said they want stricter curbs on immigration and advocate conservative social values and more sovereignty for the country within the European Union. \"Catholic values are important to me. I know he shares them,\" Warsaw pensioner Lila Chojecka, 60, told AFP as she came to cast her ballot for Nawrocki. Trzaskowski voters tend to back greater integration within the EU and an acceleration of social reforms. Trzaskowski supports introducing civil partnerships for same-sex couples and easing Poland's near-total ban on abortion. Malgorzata Wojciechowska, a tour guide and teacher in her fifties, said Polish women \"unfortunately do not have the same rights as our European friends\". Anna Materska-Sosnowska, a political scientist at the University of Warsaw, called the election \"a real clash of civilisations\". CAMPAIGN CONTROVERSIES Nawrocki's victory is likely to embolden the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023. Some analysts have predicted it could lead to fresh parliamentary elections if political deadlock with the government persists. Nawrocki's campaign was overshadowed at times by controversies over the circumstances in which he bought an apartment from an elderly man and his football hooligan past. A former amateur boxer, Nawrocki also strongly denied media reports in the last days of the campaign that he had procured sex workers while working as a security guard at a hotel. His opposition to Ukraine's NATO membership also brought heavy criticism from Ukrainian officials. Nawrocki used his last campaign hours on Friday to leave flowers at a monument to Poles killed by Ukrainian nationalists during World War II. \"It was a genocide against the Polish people,\" he said. Poland is an EU and NATO member and a fast-growing economy of 38 million people with a leading role in international diplomacy surrounding Ukraine. It is also a key supply route for Western arms and aid going into Ukraine.",

        "content": "Senate President Francis Escudero —NIÑO JESUS ORBETA Vice President Sara Duterte —GRIG C. MONTEGRANDE MANILA, Philippines — Sen. Francis “Chiz” Escudero on Monday said his decision to delay the impeachment proceedings against Vice President Sara Duterte was unrelated to talks of a possible change in Senate leadership. Escudero moved the presentation of the Articles of Impeachment against Duterte from June 2 to June 11, citing the priority legislation they need to pass before the 19th Congress adjourns sine die. READ: Presentation of impeachment articles vs Sara Duterte moved to June 11 He said the change in schedule had nothing to do with the reported contest for the Senate presidency in the next Congress. “I don’t see the connection whatsoever, no,” Escudero said at a press conference in the Senate. “It has nothing to do, especially given the fact that the 20th Congress will have a totally different composition,” he added. The Senate chief though, admitted there were discussions about the Senate leadership as earlier revealed by Senators Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa and Christopher “Bong” Go. Dela Rosa disclosed that Escudero had reached out to their group, dubbed as the Duterte bloc, about the Senate leadership. READ: Escudero reaches out to Duterte bloc amid Senate shake-up murmurs Dela Rosa also identified his colleagues in the Duterte bloc as Go, Senators Robin Padilla and Imee Marcos, and Senator-elect Rodante Marcoleta. Go, meanwhile, said both Escudero and Senator-elect Vicente “Tito” Sotto III are seeking the support of their group for the Senate presidency. READ: Escudero, Sotto seek Duterte bloc’s support for Senate presidency – Go “We’re talking—they’re all my friends. We’re discussing work not just for the 19th but also for the 20th,” Escudero said when asked if he is already wooing his colleagues. “But in my view, it’s still too early — whatever the answer is now might change next week or next month, so all the discussions and preparations happening now feel a bit premature,” he added.

        "description": "In today’s newsletter: Reform’s latest policy shift echoes strategies seen in Europe’s far right. Will this approach gain traction in the UK?",
        "content": "Good morning. In 2023, Nigel Farage went on a podcast to decry what he described as a culture of “welfarism” in the UK, insisting it was making millions of people in the country lazy. “‘I’m too fat, I’m too stupid, I’m too lazy, I don’t get out of bed in the morning. I smoke drugs, give me money’,” he said. “‘I don’t need to work, the state will provide for me’ ... We cannot afford it.” Less than two years later, the self-styled free-market crusader seems to be singing a different tune. Last week, he publicly backed the removal of the two-child benefit cap – a move that would lift 350,000 children out of poverty overnight and ease hardship for 700,000 more. So, what changed? At a press conference , he explained that removing the cap would help lower-paid workers have children. But then came the caveat: “I want to emphasise that this is aimed at British families. It’s not aimed at those that come into the country and suddenly decide to have a lot of children.” He didn’t stop there. Farage also floated more generous tax breaks for married couples, if elected, and tougher restrictions on abortion. He called the current 24-week limit “ludicrous”. This isn’t a new strategy in Europe. Farage appears to be mirroring Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, a pioneer in blending anti-immigration rhetoric with anti-abortion measures, while promoting nativist policies to boost birthrates. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Sian Norris , author of Bodies Under Siege: How the Far-Right Attack on Reproductive Rights Went Global, about how these tactics are gaining ground in the UK, and what they could mean for the future of reproductive rights. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories In depth: ‘Chipping away at abortion rights makes it easier to chip away at the next one’ When Sian Norris first began investigating the UK’s anti-abortion movement, she came across an organisation called UK Life League. Its founder, Jim Dowson , is perhaps better known for starting the far-right party Britain First. At first glance, the group seemed focused solely on opposing abortion. But once she started digging into their language and literature, it was clear that anti-abortion and anti-immigration rhetoric were being fused together. Alongside the usual scaremongering about migrants “replacing” white Britons ran a parallel narrative: that feminists were suppressing the white birthrate through abortion and contraception. Together, these ideas were feeding the same conspiracy theory – the so-called “ great replacement ”. The group’s magazine, Rescue, didn’t exactly hide it. “It would say things like: the children in our classrooms are being replaced by aliens, meaning migrant children, and that white babies were being aborted. It was very full of praise for people like Viktor Orbán and his family protection policy and his anti-migrant policies.” The moment it all clicked for Norris was when she saw a cartoon shared by Mark Collette, the founder of far-right group Patriotic Alternative. “It was a picture of hijabi-wearing women in a maternity clinic and white women in an abortion clinic with the caption ‘this is white genocide’. It’s this idea that white women are not doing their ‘duty’ making white babies.” Norris also points to the man who carried out the terrorist attack against Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand. In his manifesto, he fixated on declining birthrates and blamed what he called “selfish individualism” among women for not having enough children. These links between anti-abortion politics and the far right, Norris said, shouldn’t come as a surprise. Often misogyny is the gateway drug to the far right for young men. “If you’ve got male supremacy in your head, then white supremacy is the next obvious step.” *** The Orbán playbook A couple of months ago, Norris went undercover to a Reform rally in Birmingham. In one event, the host was “throwing out Labour policies” to gauge the audience’s reactions, she said. Some topics got big reactions, like winter fuel allowance cuts or the lack of housing for veterans. But when it came to proposed cuts to disability benefits, she told me, “it was crickets.” The silence was revealing. “Benefits themselves aren’t really a motivating issue for Reform voters,” she said. Farage was quite explicit about this when he backed calls to scrap the two-child benefit cap, not because he supports “a benefits culture”. He is first and foremost concerned with demographic concerns. Norris described that as a “classic tactic” from the far right when it comes to natalist policies. “Orbán is the European politician that really normalised great replacement conspiracy theory. He was the one that would go to conferences and talk about replacement, talk about demographics. He would say that if you wanted a Christian Hungary and a Christian Europe, the way to do this was to incentivise ethnic Hungarian married women to have more children,” she said. “And, we know that Farage is really influenced by the kind of Orban, US conservatism movement.” She added that, for Farage, the driving force of this policy is not a concern about child poverty. “He’s talking about it because he wants more British women to have more British babies, and the fact that it would be coupled with this tax break for married couples is again a learned tactic from the far right in terms of what kind of families we value.” *** A new front in the culture war Farage has been active in British politics for more than three decades, but until recently, he had said very little about abortion. That changed last November, when he called for parliament to debate reducing the legal abortion limit from 24 weeks, citing advances in medical technology. The remarks marked a notable shift, which worries Norris. “It feels like this is going to be the new front in the culture war. We know that the far right is very good at working out which issues are going to work in different territories. So in Poland, it’s very much about abortion. In Romania, it’s very much LGBT rights,” she said. Norris described the 24-week abortion limit as “the wedge” when it comes to anti-abortion campaigning. “Abortion has mass popular support in this country. The British Attitudes Survey puts it at about 90% support for abortion in some circumstances,” she said. “But people do get really emotional about the 24-week limit because of foetus viability and the fact that you can technically have a baby below 24 weeks.” It’s a tactic designed to trigger outrage and force a polarising debate, she explained. Supporters of abortion rights are pushed to defend procedures that are already rare and deeply complex. Only about 1% of UK abortions take place after 20 weeks, and these are almost always carried out in exceptional circumstances, such as severe foetal abnormalities or serious risks to the mother’s health. “I think it’s going to be a whipping up of cultural values. It will be framed as: are you the mad, woke, pro-abortion side or the traditional, family-centric, anti-abortion side? That really concerns me,” Norris said. Her reporting has uncovered links between rightwing MPs and US-backed Christian charities funding anti-abortion campaigns in the UK. These groups, she says, are already laying the groundwork ahead of a potential parliamentary debate over legislation that would remove the threat of imprisonment for women who terminate a pregnancy after 24 weeks. They would be using trialled and tested messaging and tactics, Norris explained, most notably in the US. “As soon as you start chipping away at abortion rights, it’s much easier to chip away at the next one,” she warned. “We’ll go from 24 weeks to 22 weeks, and then, ‘well, what about 20 weeks?’ And then, ‘what about if we add in this extra barrier and say you have an ultrasound, or have to have counselling’?” *** The right direction It’s still unclear how successful Farage will be with this new strategy. Over the past decade, the UK has seen a string of major victories for abortion rights: decriminalisation in Northern Ireland, the permanent adoption of telemedicine after the pandemic and the introduction of buffer zones around clinics. Now, the focus is on the upcoming parliamentary vote to decriminalise abortion. The vote, originally scheduled for last year, was expected to pass, even under a Conservative majority. “Now I think with a Labour majority there’s an even bigger chance of that happening. So I do think politically we are moving in the right direction and the momentum is for the pro-abortion movement,” Norris said. While she remains concerned about abortion becoming the next front in the UK’s culture wars, Norris is confident that public support remains strong. “The anti-abortion movement is very noisy, but it is pretty small.” This is true, she added, even on a global scale. Although Roe v Wade was overturned in America, there were also significant global wins. In 2020, Argentina legalised abortion up to 14 weeks of pregnancy. In Mexico, in 2023, the supreme court decriminalised abortion across the country. Norris points to a report by the Centre for Reproductive Rights, which found that over the past 30 years, more than 60 countries and territories have liberalised their abortion laws. Only four have rolled back access.

        "content": "US President Trump recently shared another conspiracy theory on social media, saying his predecessor, Joe Biden, was \"executed in 2020\" and replaced by a robotic clone. The outlandish claim is the latest example of the Republican leader amplifying false material to his millions of followers on social media, and comes days after he claimed white South African farmers were victims of mass killings. The American President reposted a fringe rant from another user on his social media platform, Truth Social, that read, \"There is no #JoeBiden-executed in 2020. #Biden clones, doubles & robotic engineered soulless mindless entities are what you see. >#Democrats don't know the difference.\" Trump's remark came days after Biden admitted he was diagnosed with an “aggressive form\" of prostate cancer. So far, the White House has not commented on the President's post. In the past, Trump has assailed former President Biden's mental acuity during the end of his tenure and blamed his frail health for all manner of societal ills. He has also promoted theories suggesting Biden's aids used an autopen to enact policies and issue pardons without the Democrat's knowledge. Trump's penchant for sharing debunked or baseless theories is not limited to social media. Last month, while hosting South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office, Trump claimed that white South Africans were victims of genocide, even though police data do not show that the white population in the African nation was any more vulnerable than other groups. According to a report by The New York Times, the Republican leader's first term in the White House was filled with false or misleading statements. He reportedly made 30,573 misleading remarks, or 21 a day on average, and repeatedly shared conspiracy theories in the lead-up to the 2024 election. An NYT analysis of the President's thousands of social media posts and reposts over a six-month period in 2024 found that at least 330 of them described both a false, secretive plot against him or the American people and a specific entity supposedly responsible for it. These included suggestions that the FBI had ordered his assassination and accusations that government officials had orchestrated the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.

        "content": "LOS ANGELES — There had to be an asterisk. Actually, make that two. The New York Yankees couldn’t just enjoy stopping the rival Los Angeles Dodgers from earning a three-game sweep over them with a convincing 7-3 win on Sunday night. They had to leave Dodger Stadium and file into their private Delta charter for their six-hour flight home, not knowing what awaited left fielder Jasson Domínguez and closer Luke Weaver, who were injured during the game. Advertisement First, Domínguez left the game in the sixth inning due to a left thumb bruise he suffered sliding headfirst while stealing second base in the fifth inning. Then Weaver felt tightness in his hamstring while stretching after warming up just before he was set to enter in the ninth inning, manager Aaron Boone said. Domínguez “jammed his thumb” on his slide, reaching for the base with his exposed hand rather than his right hand, which was protected with a sliding mitt. Cody Bellinger took over for him. “There’s nothing to worry about,” Domínguez said. Still, Boone said Domínguez would likely get tests during Monday’s off day in New York City. Domínguez said he realized he had to leave the game when he had difficulty trying to grip his bat. Would he consider wearing protective mitts on both hands when he runs the bases? “Definitely now, yes,” he said. Weaver “felt something in the middle of his hammy” just before he was about to enter the game, the manager said, though he didn’t specify which leg was injured. Boone said he had to “make a switch on the fly” when he went to lefty Tim Hill, who worked a 1-2-3 ninth inning and pumped his fist after the final out. “I’m hoping it’s not too serious,” Boone said of Weaver’s injury. Losing either Domínguez or Weaver for any amount of time would be a blow to the Yankees, who are 36-22 with a 5 1/2-game lead in the American League East. Bellinger would surely take over everyday reps in place of the switch-hitting Domínguez, who has had a strong overall season (.247 batting average, six home runs, 25 RBIs) but has especially been good hitting lefty (.854 OPS). He’s been less productive as a righty (.573 OPS). Bellinger went into Sunday hitting .315 with a .939 OPS over his previous 23 games before getting hit by a pitch and walking in the win. Advertisement Replacing Weaver would be more difficult. Devin Williams has an 8.10 ERA in 12 save situations this year. The Yankees traded for him in the offseason, thinking he would be their closer, but they had to give the job to Weaver, who has put up a 1.05 ERA in 24 appearances. The Yankees could also look to Jonathan Loáisiga and Mark Leiter Jr. Boone didn’t describe Weaver’s pain outside of saying, “It was enough to take him out.” ‘Beer tub’ The Yankees spent the weekend downplaying facing the Dodgers in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Yet, they seemed particularly relieved to have won Sunday. A hip-hop playlist pulsed through the clubhouse speakers. There was a cooler in the back-right corner with two words written on it: “Beer tub.” Several players helped themselves. On Friday, the Yankees watched ace Max Fried stumble for the first time this season in an 8-5 loss. On Saturday, the Dodgers dominated rookie starter Will Warren en route to an 18-2 beatdown. “This team has bounced back from whatever ‘tough’ losses we’ve had,” Boone said. “We’ve had a handful of them in the first couple months of the year. Yesterday, I don’t know if it was tough but it was noisy though, and I know a lot of people are making a lot of it.” DJ LeMahieu, who had his first four-hit game since 2021, said, “It was just good to get the win.” “They’re a great team and we feel pretty good about where we’re at,” catcher Austin Wells said. “... The atmosphere was great. Besides yesterday, I felt like we played pretty good games.” Yarbrough outlasts Yamamoto Crafty lefty Ryan Yarbrough’s impressive run continued when he outpaced Dodgers star righty Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who lasted just 3 2/3 innings and gave up four earned runs. Yarbrough’s six-inning, one-run performance dropped his ERA to 2.08 in five starts since joining the rotation on May 3. He struck out a season-high five, including Shohei Ohtani to start the game. He also fanned the last two batters he faced. Advertisement “He’s fun to watch, man,” Boone said of Yarbrough. “He’s different than anything you face.” Yarbrough’s sweeper was especially impressive. The Dodgers whiffed seven times on 10 swings against it. “I think it was just part of the game plan,” he said of using his sweeper. “It was part of something to speed them up, and then using it to slow them down. Keep them in between.” Yarbrough said he hasn’t changed much since joining the Yankees after he elected free agency from the Toronto Blue Jays at the end of spring training. “It’s been more about game planning and understanding how everything works and moves,” he said. “Maybe little tweaks with pitches but nothing super crazy. Just really understanding how everything moves and really utilizing my whole arsenal.” Rice, Rice, Baby 🍚 pic.twitter.com/WD85wRJVvy — New York Yankees (@Yankees) June 1, 2025 The last time Yamamoto faced the Yankees, he gave up just one run in 6 1/3 innings in Game 2 of the World Series. This time? The Yankees tagged him with Ben Rice’s two-run home run in the third inning and seven hits total. He also walked three batters and threw 96 pitches. “We made him throw stuff in the zone,” Wells said. “I’m not entirely too sure what the difference was today, but we got him out of there with a high pitch count.” “That’s who they are when they’re at their best,” Boone said. “Similar to the Dodgers, they make you earn it. It’s what the really good offenses do. They control the strike zone. I thought we did a really good job with that today.” (Top photo of Jasson Domínguez stealing second base in the fifth inning.

        "description": "Karol Nawrocki’s victory deals blow to Donald Tusk’s pro-EU coalition government",
        "content": "Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by Donald Trump , has won Poland ’s tightly fought presidential election against centrist candidate Rafal Trzaskowski . Polish voters cast their ballots on Sunday in a tightly fought race, the result of which was expected to shape the country's political future and its relations with the EU. Mr Nawrocki, 42, a Eurosceptic nationalist, won 50.89 per cent of the votes cast while Mr Trzaskowski, a liberal Warsaw mayor, won 49.11 per cent after the final count, according to Onet . Mr Nawrocki, a historian and amateur boxer who ran a national remembrance institute, campaigned on a promise to ensure economic and social policies favouring Poles over other nationalities, including refugees from neighbouring Ukraine . Overnight projections after the polling showed Mr Nawrocki leading Mr Trzaskowski by a fraction of a percentage point. However, the race was too close to call as two of the three exit polls showed Mr Trzaskowski leading ahead of Mr Nawrocki. As votes were still being counted, a set of preliminary results combining exit polls and counted ballots at 1am local time on Monday showed Mr Nawrocki ahead with 50.7 per cent of the vote over Trzaskowski with 49.3 per cent. Locked in a near-dead heat, both candidates claimed victory in meetings with their supporters in Warsaw before the result was out. “We won,” Mr Trzaskowski told his supporters. “This is truly a special moment in Poland 's history. I am convinced that it will allow us to move forward and focus on the future. I will be your president.\" Mr Nawrocki, speaking to his supporters at a separate event in Warsaw, said he believed he was on track for victory. \"We’ll win and save Poland,\" he said. \"We must win tonight.\" A victory for Mr Trzaskowski, a liberal pro-EU politician, was set to strengthen prime minister Donald Tusk ’s pro-European agenda and help curb the rise of the far-right across Europe. In contrast, Mr Nawrocki’s win was expected to threaten the stability of Mr Tusk’s coalition and deepen rifts between Poland and its EU neighbours. Mr Nawrocki, 42, aligned with US conservatives, including US president Trump, was backed by the right-wing Law and Justice party. Last month, Mr Trump invited Mr Nawrocki to the Oval office and US homeland security secretary Kristi Noem had urged Poles to elect him, saying he had the capability of working together with Mr Trump. “He needs to be the next president of Poland,” Ms Noem said. While the Polish presidency is largely ceremonial with limited sway over foreign policy and defence, the president enjoys veto power over legislation – a significant check on prime minister Tusk’s pro-EU coalition which lacks the parliamentary majority needed to override it. The vote on Sunday was a runoff between the two highest vote winners in the first round of the election on 18 May when Mr Trzaskowski held a lead, but marginally. Mr Trzaskowski had won just over 31 per cent and Mr Nawrocki nearly 30 per cent, eliminating 11 other candidates. From 2015 to 2023, Poland was ruled by the nationalist Law and Justice party, which curbed abortion rights and expanded state control over the media. Though a centrist coalition led by Mr Tusk came to power in 2023, president Andrzej Duda – a conservative ally of Law and Justice – remained in office, enabling him to block much of Tusk’s agenda. Mr Duda’s term ends this summer and the race to succeed him is widely seen as a referendum on Mr Tusk, whose popularity is waning amid challenges in pushing through key reforms. The election attracted widespread international attention as it was being held in Ukraine ’s neighbourhood where Russia ’s war raised security fears. While candidates support aid to Kyiv, Mr Nawrocki opposes Nato membership for Ukraine while Mr Trzaskowski supports it in the future. Mr Nawrocki’s campaign drew on themes popular among the American right, particularly a focus on traditional values. His supporters fear Mr Trzaskowski’s pro-EU position could cede too much control over Polish affairs to European powers like France and Germany. Many European centrists had rallied behind Mr Trzaskowski, viewing him as a defender of democratic values at a time when they were under threat from rising authoritarianism worldwide.",

The crisis escalated after Tej Pratap Yadav, elder son of Lalu Prasad Yadav, publicly revealed he had been in a 12-year relationship with a woman named Anushka, despite being married. This shocking revelation led Lalu Prasad to expel him not only from the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) for six years but also from the family. Tej Pratap responded by hinting at betrayal within the family, using the word “Jaichand” — a historical term for traitor. Political observers, including veteran journalist Kanhaiya Bhillari, suggested this might be a veiled attack on Sanjay Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav’s political advisor, signaling a possible power struggle within the RJD. BJP spokesperson AK Bajpai lashed out at the Yadavs, calling their family synonymous with “jungle raj” and corruption in Bihar. He accused Tej Pratap of disrespecting women and dismissed the feud as childish antics, but emphasized that the NDA would come to power in Bihar. The debate intensified as it was speculated that Tej Pratap, despite his outburst, would be denied an election ticket, although he might be accommodated later via MLC or Rajya Sabha. The BJP’s Shazia Ilmi also joined the discussion, reinforcing the perception that RJD’s internal discord exposes the weakness of dynastic politics. As personal accusations spilled into the public domain, the question looms: Is this a family breakdown or a carefully timed political chess move? And more importantly — who is the real \"Jaichand\" in the Yadav family saga?",

He accused Tej Pratap of disrespecting women and dismissed the feud as childish antics, but emphasized that the NDA would come to power in Bihar. The debate intensified as it was speculated that Tej Pratap, despite his outburst, would be denied an election ticket, although he might be accommodated later via MLC or Rajya Sabha. The BJP’s Shazia Ilmi also joined the discussion, reinforcing the perception that RJD’s internal discord exposes the weakness of dynastic politics. As personal accusations spilled into the public domain, the question looms: Is this a family breakdown or a carefully timed political chess move? And more importantly — who is the real \"Jaichand\" in the Yadav family saga?",

        "description": "Donald Trump's love for coming up with slogans and snappy acronyms has made him popular on the Wall Street. Now, investors have gone a step further and created their own acronyms, some which may not sit well with the US president",
        "content": "Four months into President Donald Trump’s second term, market observers have taken a cue from his fondness for condensing slogans into catchy acronyms like Maga, Doge and Maha, and devised a few of their own that have been spreading across trading desks. Even those acronyms that do not directly reflect a specific trading strategy, still capture factors that traders say are important in Trump-era markets, such as volatility and uncertainty, that investors need to consider when making decisions. Some of the new labels are associated with investment strategies that aimed to capitalise on Trump’s economic and trade policies and international relations goals. Others riff off economic implications or his abrupt U-turns as markets and trade partners react to his proposals. The “Trump Trade” that played on the Make America Great Again theme in the wake of his November election victory and January inauguration, and contributed to record highs on Wall Street in February, is hardly discussed now that stocks, the dollar and Treasury bonds have succumbed to worries about his tariff policies. “Post the election, we heard a lot about Yolo (You Only Live Once), which seemed to promote taking outsize risks in a concentrated investment theme,” Art Hogan, strategist at B. Riley Wealth, said. Yolo, is an acronym used to describe the tendency that was part of the Trump trade to chase high-momentum strategies such as cryptocurrency. “While the term Yolo was popular for a period of time, it goes against all traditional advice,” Hogan said. Here are a few more acronyms that have gotten play in the investment world in recent weeks: This one, coined by a Financial Times columnist, has been used as a way to describe Trump’s to-ing and fro-ing on tariffs in the wake of his April 2 “Liberation Day” speech. When asked about Taco in a recent press conference , the president lashed out, calling the question “nasty” “Where we end up might not be too far from what he promised on the campaign trail. So, does he always chicken out? I wouldn’t go as far as to say that,” said Christian DiClementi, fixed income portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein. “I think that he wants to rebalance the economy without pushing it off a cliff. And we’re watching that being executed in real-time. I think some of the ideas are thought out and some of them change on the fly.” Mega first coined last year to address European competitiveness, resurfaced this Spring as a way to describe the flurry of investor interest in and flows into European markets. Mega hats, spoofing their Maga counterparts, are easily purchased online It’s been revived by investors and traders in light of the outperformance of European stocks in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs bombshell. While the original Trump Trade was also known as the Maga trade, this variation cribbed the president’s motto, first appearing in response to Vice President JD Vance’s brief and unfruitful visit to Greenland, the autonomous territory of Denmark , which Trump has expressed interest in annexing. At least one Canadian investor says that quip is making the rounds of trading desks in Toronto and Montreal and sparking “wishful thinking” about simply boycotting US investments. Although the acronym also came into being well before Trump’s inauguration, it is being heard with increasing frequency in trading desk conversations. It is used to capture the financial market’s volatility and chaos that Trump’s policy-making process has created. Mark Spindel, chief investment officer of Potomac River Capital LLC, described the market as being caught in a “pinball machine as a result of that policy-making process.” When reached for comment, White House spokesman Kush Desai said in an email “these asinine acronyms convey how unserious analysts have consistently beclowned themselves by mocking President Trump and his agenda that have already delivered multiple expectation-beating jobs and inflation reports, trillions in investment commitments, a historic UK trade agreement and rising consumer confidence.”",

        "description": "Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb addresses a press conference in Islamabad on June 13, 2024. —AFPParliament’s constitutional ‘power of the purse’ is meant to anchor democratic control over public money, yet in Pakistan the reality rarely lives up to the...",
        "content": "Parliament’s constitutional ‘power of the purse’ is meant to anchor democratic control over public money, yet in Pakistan the reality rarely lives up to the principle. The constitution and the Public Financial Management (PFM) Act 2019 oblige the executive to furnish four core documents to the National Assembly every year: a Budget Strategy Paper (BSP) approved by the federal cabinet no later than May 10 following amendments to the original March 15 deadline; a Fiscal Risk Statement alongside the annual budget; a Half-Yearly Budget Review by end-February; and quarterly debt and contingent-liability reports. Between FY2020 and FY2024, fewer than half of these papers were tabled on schedule, and even when delivered, the ensuing debate was perfunctory and almost never resulted in altered appropriations. As far as I understand, the Budget Strategy Paper, which was required to be presented to the Standing Committee on Finance, has still not been presented. In the same period, supplementary grants totalling roughly over Rs1.3 trillion were retroactively regularised – contravening section 23 of the Public Financial Management (PFM) Act 2019, which requires ex-ante parliamentary approval. Committees theoretically possess expansive summons powers and may recommend reallocations, yet they seldom exercise them, hamstrung by skeletal secretariats, patchy data access and an ingrained reticence to confront the executive. It is into this vacuum that the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) Bill 2025 has been proposed. Modelled on the United States Congressional Budget Office (1974), Canada’s Parliamentary Budget Officer (2006), Australia’s PBO (2012), and South Korea’s National Assembly Budget Office (2003), the bill will establish a non-partisan research arm tasked with costing legislation, projecting debt paths, and issuing public assessments of the macro-fiscal outlook. In those comparator countries, offices manned by dozens – and in the CBO’s case, hundreds – of economists, statisticians and policy modellers have become indispensable to legislative deliberation: the US Congress will not vote on a major bill without a CBO ‘score’; both major parties trust Australian election-policy costings; and South Korean programme evaluations by NABO routinely trigger reallocations. The attraction of grafting such a model onto Pakistan’s legislative architecture is obvious, yet transplantation may fail if the political and administrative soil is inhospitable. The National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) already possess the authority to summon officials, scrutinise accounts and propose amendments, but they operate with limited staff and even more limited analytical bandwidth. However, their findings and recommendations are not binding on the executive. Adding a new institution risks duplicating mandates while diluting responsibility. Cost is another hurdle: Australia’s PBO consumes about AUD9 million a year, near Rs1.6 billion, chiefly in specialist salaries. Even if parliament sets aside comparable funds, success would still hinge on the executive’s willingness to share comprehensive, timely data; without it, the PBO would produce elegant but hollow spreadsheets. Implementation risk is heightened by Pakistan’s record of legislative inflation, which creates new authorities instead of enforcing existing laws. Celebrated as a transparency milestone, the PFM Act itself remains under-implemented. After the SOE (Governance and Operations) Act 2023, dozens of state-owned-enterprise boards were restructured on paper, yet many still await independent directors and timely audited statements. A PBO could join this shelf of worthy but toothless institutions unless parliament first proves it will insist on, debate and act upon the information it already commands. The primary bottleneck is not architecture but analytical capacity and political will. Lawmakers typically receive multi-volume budget books only a few days before the vote; few have formal training in public finance, and constituency pressures divert focus toward local projects rather than macro-fiscal sustainability. In theory, a full-scale PBO could bridge that gap by translating dense tables into digestible briefs. Yet a leaner, more immediate solution exists: bolster the Research and Legislative Drafting Directorate with a Budget Analysis Unit (BAU) of eight to ten macro-fiscal specialists seconded for three-year fellowships from the State Bank, reputable audit firms, universities, and multilateral partners. Such a unit could start costing bills, testing revenue assumptions, and briefing committees within months at a fraction of a PBO’s expense, scaling only once legislators prove sustained demand. At the same time, appropriate PFM Act amendments could hard-wire accountability without spawning another entity. Parliament/Standing Committee on Finance and Public Accounts Committees should have the power to impose penalties / public censure on ministries that miss statutory filing deadlines. Open, time-bound hearings on the BSP and Half-Yearly Review should be mandatory, with civil-society submissions posted online within 48 hours. Critically, the budget presented after vetting by the IMF must not be treated as untouchable; members must subject it to rigorous clause-by-clause scrutiny, proposing evidence-based amendments where warranted. None of this requires novel legislation – only the courage to use existing and proposed additional powers. International experience is unequivocal: independent fiscal offices thrive where legislatures defend their autonomy and embed their analysis in decision-making. The UK offers a nuanced counter-example: it relies on the executive-branch Office for Budget Responsibility, yet the House of Commons Library’s small Scrutiny Unit still equips a formidable Treasury Committee capable of grilling chancellors line-by-line. In Germany, the Bundestag’s Research Service underpins a Budget Committee endowed with a constitutional veto over appropriations; German MPs will block a budget that lacks credible detail. By contrast, Ghana’s PBO (2018) languishes for want of funds and data, while Croatia’s fiscal office is so thinly staffed that parliamentary groups outsource analysis to think-tanks. Form without force is futility. Pakistan can ill afford futility when public debt hovers near 80% of GDP, interest payments swallow more than half of federal tax revenue, and the country remains under IMF surveillance to avert default. Citizens already perceive budgets as distant rituals unmoored from service delivery. Restoring trust requires that allocations be visibly tied to measurable outcomes and that overruns be explained before, not after, they occur. These improvements can arrive sooner by enforcing the PFM Act (with targeted tweaks) and up-skilling committees than by launching a PBO whose independence and funding would be contested in an increasingly polarised arena. None of this means the PBO idea should be discarded. It may serve as a long-term aspiration, a legislative stake in the ground signaling parliament’s commitment to deeper scrutiny once foundational deficiencies are addressed. A pragmatic sequencing could sunset key clauses: let the lean BAU operate for three fiscal cycles, during which parliament must certify utilisation benchmarks – costings requested, briefs delivered, debates influenced. Only after meeting those benchmarks would the full-fledged PBO, with its larger staff and statutory guarantees, come into force. This phased approach echoes South Korea, where an initially modest NABO was empowered only after the legislature demonstrated it could absorb the analysis. Ultimately, fiscal accountability hinges less on institutional logos than on legislative muscle. Lawmakers must first demonstrate that they will demand the documents already due, summon ministers when deadlines slip, and vote amendments when national priorities conflict with executive proposals. Equipping them with a cadre of skilled analysts and strictly enforcing existing reporting requirements will test that resolve quickly and cheaply. If those reforms take root, an expanded Parliamentary Budget Office – embedded through amendments to the PFM Act rather than via additional new legislation — could then elevate oversight to global best practice. Until that day, the wisest course is to fix the budget oversight we ostensibly possess before adding another layer that risks widening the gap between statute and reality.

        "description": "Concerns are growing about housing conditions in the borough.",
        "content": "For a Stockport mum, a simple walk to the shop has become a terrifying ordeal. Jayne Warner brought home her newborn son three weeks ago, but she never imagined the fear she would feel in her own flat. She lives in an 11th floor property in Pendlebury Tower on the Lancashire Hill estate, which is managed by Stockport Homes, with her children aged nine, six, two, and ten weeks. Her 10-week son was born with “complex” medical needs, including a cleft palate, and has a tube in his nose to help with breathing. But in the family’s apartment building, Jayne says the lifts keep breaking down, leaving her constantly on edge. The 32-year-old mum is worried that they could end up trapped inside a broken lift, or struggle to get help in their flat in an emergency if the lifts don’t work. It has left her frightened to leave the house in fear of what could happen. \"It's scaring the life out of me,” she said. “He came home three weeks ago, if something happens, how is anyone going to save him? “It's not safe for us here now. I'm scared of going out some days in case I can't get back in my flat, or if the lift breaks and we get stuck.” She says the lifts are breaking “weekly or sometimes daily” in the tower block, and that the issue has been going on for some time. Stockport Homes said it is doing everything it can to help Jayne and her family move to a more suitable home as quickly as possible. “Her application has been properly assessed, and we’re in active contact to explore every available option for her circumstance - including mutual exchange,” a Stockport Homes spokesperson said. “Sadly, this isn’t a challenge unique to Stockport. Across the country, demand for accessible and family-sized social housing far outstrips supply - especially for households with more complex needs.” Jayne says she’s been given a medical assessment for her son “in four to six weeks”, which can help with getting a move to another home. But the situation has left her with a bitter taste, with the mum saying that Stockport Homes “don’t care” about her needs. Jayne’s situation is not the only problem experienced by Stockport Homes tenants. The social housing provider is the biggest landlord in the borough, managing more than 12,000 homes for Stockport council , private landlords, and its own stock. In March, residents in a 15-storey tower block managed by Stockport Homes in Edgeley said they felt like \"prisoners\" when both lifts broke at the same time, taking weeks to repair. The issues in the Hollywood Towers building on Hardman Street left some people having to tackle several flights of stairs each time they left the building. It happened at the same time as letters were sent to residents telling them of a new 77p weekly lift maintenance charge from April 7. Stockport Homes said its teams were active at Hollywood Towers to check if residents needed any extra help while the lifts were being fixed. It had staff based at the block seven days a week to assist anyone struggling to access their home with care packages, including collecting prescriptions, help with travel, supporting parcel delivery and carrying heavy items, help which it said was “well received by residents”. A spokesperson said at the time: “Within two days, 64 residents had been personally engaged. In addition, regular updates have been shared via text messages, emails, and the digital notice board. “We know this has been a really challenging time, and we appreciate residents’ patience and understanding.” The lifts were repaired after what was said to be delays sourcing spare parts, but the problems faced by tenants in Stockport Homes properties has left some councillors demanding urgent improvement. James Frizzell can often be found out and about on the Lancashire Hill estate speaking to residents and housing officers. The Reddish South councillor knows the patch well, but has major concerns about the welfare of people living there. The blocks were first built in the 1960s, and some feel the estate is in need of huge investment. Coun Frizzell told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) that residents in Lancashire Hill are facing “serious problems” every day. “As councillors, we have received increasing reports of cockroach and rodent infestation across the estate, as well as ongoing problems with the heating system and unreliable lifts,” he said. “Stockport Homes has been addressing these issues as they arise, but the reality is that the fabric of the buildings is old and near the end of its useful life. Repairs and patching up can only go so far.” Stockport Homes said it is stepping up wider prevention work with residents to help reduce the risk of rodent infestation reoccurring, including monitoring and maintenance activity, as well as advice and support for residents to help keep homes pest-free. Stockport Homes and the council's pest control service said that pest-related issues are not widespread, adding: \"we want to reassure residents that we're on top of this - with both responsive action where needed and proactive work to protect everyone’s living conditions.\" Concerns about Stockport Homes have also been made public by Stockport Labour , the biggest opposition group in the council chamber. Last year, the Labour group called for an independent review of the social housing model in Stockport. Stockport Homes manages the council’s housing stock, but operates independently as an arms length management organisation (ALMO). The review was called to judge whether the model was still the right one for Stockport. Former Stockport Labour group leader, Coun David Meller, said in a meeting in February 2024 that the council was giving Stockport Homes £35m a year, but warned that the council needed “to be certain as we can that we won't have a tragedy like Awaab Ishak on our doorsteps.” Stockport Labour’s new leader, Coun Christine Carrigan, has also raised concerns about Stockport Homes. She told the LDRS that “no family should be living with constant fear about their safety in their own home” - in reference to Jayne Warner's situation - and made calls for “greater accountability and transparency\" from Stockport Homes. The review into social housing was carried out by Deloitte and found that Stockport Homes is a ‘high performing’ organisation, with a suggestion of keeping the existing model of operation as an arm's length management organisation (ALMO). It was good news for the social housing landlord and its staff, who say they are working under major pressure to cope with the national housing crisis. But the review highlighted a perceived culture of ‘defensiveness’ and a ‘lack of accountability’ at Stockport Homes when dealing with concerns raised by councillors. It also revealed a ‘lack of timely communication during repairs and complaints’ which has created ‘significant anxiety and uncertainty for tenants’ and contributed to ‘eroding trust.’ Coun Carrigan said she has been left feeling frustrated with the lack of progress by Stockport Homes since then. She added: “We secured the independent review into them, but since its conclusion, we’ve seen little change. “Residents have been telling us that improvements on the ground are far too slow, or simply not happening.” She urged the Lib Dem leadership at the council to “take meaningful action now” to turn things around. Coun Frizzell also urged Stockport Homes to bring about improvements, especially in Lancashire Hill. He added: “Part of the recent review into the way the council manages its social housing suggests priority is given to those areas where residents are suffering the most hardship. “We will be pressing Stockport Homes and the council to prioritise Lancashire Hill, to bring meaningful improvements as quickly as possible. “We cannot and should not leave Lancashire Hill behind while, a short walk away, the town centre benefits from regeneration on a massive scale.” For its part, Stockport Homes is well aware of the concerns, which have been raised a number of times in council meetings and directly by elected members. But the organisation said it too is struggling to manage the huge demand for housing, where there are more than 6,000 people in Stockport on the housing register, with some facing a wait of up to 12 years . A spokesperson said: “We’re working within a national system that’s stretched to breaking point, but that doesn’t mean we’re standing still. “We’re reviewing all properties that become available, offering personalised advice, and pushing hard to increase the supply of genuinely affordable, accessible homes in Stockport.” Helen McHale, chief executive of Stockport Homes, told the LDRS last year that the social housing landlord is doing everything it possibly can to help residents and manage the huge housing pressures. She revealed the scale of the problem facing the borough - with around 200 applications for each property advertised. \"I'd hate for anyone to think that we didn't care, it's really important to us,” she added. Stockport council is led by the Lib Dems under a minority administration. Coun Jake Austin, the council’s cabinet member for housing and environment, said work is taking place to tackle the issues raised. \"We are aware of concerns raised at Lancashire Hill and are working with Stockport Homes, residents and councillors of all parties to address them as a priority,” he said. “Stockport, like all councils, faces significant challenges in its housing stock - which is why we continue to press the Labour government for the desperately needed funding that will give us a long-term solution. “There are no quick fixes to addressing the issues with our aging properties, but we are committed to doing everything we can to improve the situation for our residents. “We firmly believe that every Stockport resident has a right to feel safe in their own home, and we will continue to work constructively across the council to make this happen.\"",

        "content": "PETER VAN ONSELEN: All of the hints Zoe Daniel could have escaped a humiliating loss to Tim Wilson were in her five minute concession video READ MORE: Zoe Daniel's dance party after claiming victory By PETER VAN ONSELEN, POLITICAL EDITOR FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA Published: 06:03, 2 June 2025 | Updated: 06:03, 2 June 2025 e-mail View comments Former teal independent MP Zoe Daniel has finally conceded defeat. After celebrating her ‘victory’ on the night of the election - including with ecstatic dancing - before demanding a recount despite the win falling outside the margin that requires one, Daniel has eventually acknowledged that she lost. The Liberal win in the electorate of Goldstein was the only seat anywhere in the country picked up by either of the Coalition parties. The Nationals didn’t win a single seat off Labor or regional independents. Beyond defeating Daniel in Goldstein the Liberals didn’t defeat a single sitting Labor, Green or teal MP. No other teals lost their seats. On any estimate, Daniel’s failure was an isolated incident. It speaks to both the failure of the one term MP and the success of the campaign returning MP Tim Wilson ran against her. Far from being a blueprint for success, Daniel’s loss was a sure sign that something wasn’t right about her foray into parliamentary politics. Not that you’d know it if all you heard about the Goldstein showdown was Daniel’s five minute concession video posted to social media. So far as ungracious defeats go, it was right up there. Perhaps not analogous with Donald Trump’s reaction to losing the 2020 US Presidential election - but not as far off as you might have expected given the scathing commentary Daniel delivered Trump’s way soon afterwards, accusing him of struggling to accept the reality of his loss. It took an unnecessary recount demanded by Daniel and weeks of denial to pass before the loser eventually reversed her election night victory dance and called Wilson to concede. The concession video including everything from claims about supporting lower taxes (Daniel voted for cancelling the legislated stage three tax cuts and once argued for a higher GST) to complaints about dirty tricks on the campaign trail. Daniel even delivered a statement directly to Vida Goldstein whom the seat is named after (‘Vida, it’s a mission’) despite the pioneering feminist and suffragette passing away 76 years ago. There were hints in the concession speech that Daniel might run again, but no guarantees. If she does do so, she’ll need to adopt a more conciliatory style to make a better fist of it. Despite Daniel’s strong advocacy for the Palestinian cause, her concession video also included claims that she worked hard for both Jewish and pro-Palestinian constituents. Zoe Daniel celebrating the night she thought she won. She later put up video of a dance party in her office when the result suddenly became more uncertain During the course of the campaign, however, Jewish advocacy groups were critical of the stance Daniel took. It is highly likely that the Jewish vote in Goldstein was of itself enough to flip the seat given the seat has one of the highest Jewish populations of any electorate. While Daniel can be proud of winning the seat in 2022, there is little doubt that her ungracious failure to admit defeat before this weekend is a blight on her time in office. Whether it also turns out to be a nail in the coffin of any future ambition to return to parliament remains to be seen.

        "description": "No one has time for big ideas any more - and Scottish exceptionalism is collapsing",
        "content": "For 20 years, Scottish exceptionalism has been the cornerstone of our foreign policy. You may wonder what policy that is precisely, given that Scotland is still very much within the United Kingdom and foreign affairs are strictly reserved for Westminster. Since 2007, successive SNP governments under Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon, and Humza Yousaf have based the argument for independence on the idea that Scotland is inherently better than Westminster and would be a \"good global citizen\" if given the chance. However, the long-held myth of Scottish exceptionalism is collapsing, and so is the SNP's long-declining argument for Scottish independence. Survation's polling of 1,000 people shows Reform UK would move into second place as the main opposition party with 21 seats at next year’s Holyrood elections, with the Lib Dems and Greens on 10 and 8 seats, respectively. The SNP would take 58 seats, Labour on 18, and the Conservatives on 13. The SNP always argue that Scotland's values are wholly at odds with Westminster's inhumanity. With independence, we could remove nuclear weapons, prioritise human rights, avoid military engagements, and prioritise internationalism. Scotland would play a 'good guy' role with no enemies and be rewarded with tolerance, kindness, and reciprocal goodwill. Reform poll rating in Scotland hits 20 per cent However, with Reform's poll rating in Scotland rising to 20 per cent for the first time, the party is now a serious contender for the position of the principal opposition party at Holyrood. The question is, how has it gotten this bad? Voters, at their core, are hypocritical. Understanding that wins elections. Politicians all indulge in the big-picture worldview rhetorically. Scottish exceptionalism is no different. Whatever the circumstances, but especially during elections, all politicians must present a worldview and talk of solving global problems multilaterally. But no more, not as populism advances across the Western world. Even First Minister John Swinney has quietly shelved the rhetorical flourish about green and pleasant independent lands. In between the gulf of ideational nonsense and the practical realities on the ground for normal people, the populist right keeps winning and hoovering up votes. The pound in your pocket argument is where principles die. The cost-of-living crisis, the cost of food, the decimation and failure of the public sector, education, the cost of housing, the lack of affordable homes—no amount of rhetorical exceptionalism can rebalance a finance sheet if the money isn't there. Brexit is a case in point. Pro-Remain groups failed to argue why voting 'No' would benefit the pound in your pocket. As grim as it is, the interest in the war in Ukraine, the situation in Gaza, environmental collapse, and any other calamity you choose will gain support and votes if a tangible link can be made between ideas, policy, and the impact on your daily life. That is why populism wins and is on its way to Scotland. For Scots, this is a curious thing. Devolution can leave you squint-eyed at the triangulation between local government, Holyrood, and Westminster competencies and budgets. We have spent decades arguing about independence or tinkering with our place in the United Kingdom while public services crumbled to the point of general misanthropy. To state an obvious point, policy is now very much back to being about money in your pockets. No one has time for big ideas any more, and there certainly were none at the 2024 general election. Scotland is even worse because so much time was wasted on independence and other grand ideas better suited to student debate halls. Holyrood time spent virtue-signalling Holyrood has spent too much time virtue-signalling on issues which voters peripherally care about or on which the devolved body has zero influence. Only the assisted dying debate of late showed, or certainly reminded us, that devolution can be a magnificent opportunity to do things differently: debates on foreign affairs, I'm sorry to say, are not the same pressing business as the price of milk, getting a doctor's appointment or policing communities. Reform UK has ugly policies. Its weakness is that it has a campaign-savvy leader but is immature for actual governance. Its attack ads against Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election have been vile and rightly prompted cross-party condemnation. They will, nevertheless, be a forgotten incident by this time next year. But condemning something and fixing the problem are two different things. Swinney means well when he calls for and holds summits to combat a 'threat from the far right'. But it was the wrong approach and has come and gone as quickly as it was announced. The real strategy for the SNP, Labour, and all other Scottish parties to defeat populism is to produce tallied manifestos ahead of next year, down to the penny. Every party leader should be on TV with a portfolio and a calculator. It's time to account for spending, present plans, and treat it like a business. C-suite directors explaining proposals to their boards and electing shareholders. Enough waffle and scripted, meaningless performances are only fuelling the perception of incompetent elites. 2026 will not be the election of ideas. No one is interested in global issues any more unless they impact day-to-day living. Voters are anxious and disillusioned about their own lives. People are interested in saving their world, putting food on their tables, accessing doctors and dentists, and keeping the heating on. In last year's general election, Reform took 7 per cent of the vote in Scotland—not enough to win any seats, but a serious chunk of the vote for a newly formed political vehicle. Farage's Reform UK, unlike the Brexit Party and UKIP before it, is no longer chiefly an English phenomenon. The major Scottish parties forget this at their absolute peril because Farage and Reform have not. And they have their eyes set on Scotland.",

        "description": "A militant group of doctors who use social media to recruit is driving forward strike action by resident doctors.",
        "content": "A militant group of doctors who use social media to recruit is driving forward strike action by resident doctors. The current co-chairs of the British Medical Association’s (BMA) resident doctors’ committee are members of DoctorsVote, which professes to be “a grassroots organisation committed to advocating for the full pay restoration of UK doctors”. The group is prolific on social media, where disgruntled medics unite , often behind pseudonyms, seeking to forge ahead with more strikes designed to further boost their salaries. In spring, junior doctors – now referred to formally as resident doctors – were offered the biggest pay rise in the public sector in a bid to end years-long disruption to the NHS. The average full-time salary for a resident doctor will now be more than £54,000, the Department of Health and Social Care said – but the BMA wants another set of strikes to force another 30 per cent pay hike . The slogan: “Be a crab, not a scab” is used to enforce picket lines, and now crustaceans can be seen on the social media accounts of advocates. The humble crab is now shorthand for strike approval. Reddit, TikTok, Instagram and X are awash with the group, which makes use of Gen Z memes and trends to promote its message. This, in tandem with a traditional TV and PR campaign, creates a potent propaganda machine. In recent years, the group has come to dominate the BMA. The co-chairs of the BMA resident doctors’ committee in 2022-2024 both had roots in DoctorsVote. Their successors, Dr Melissa Ryan, a 45-year-old paediatrician from Nottingham, and Dr Ross Nieuwoudt, a 29-year-old surgical trainee from Merseyside, were also elected under the same banner. DoctorsVote won 70 out of 75 seats on regional junior doctor committees across England in 2023. The fresh 30 per cent demand comes on the back of a 22 per cent pay rise that Wes Streeting, the Health Secretary, and Sir Keir Starmer prioritised after Labour’s landslide election win last year. Now, the Government appears to be paying the price for it negotiation tactics . As one Tory MP told The Telegraph: “If you roll over so easily then, why would they stop now?” Or, as one anonymous doctor online put it: “We have them by the balls. Let’s squeeze.” Dr Nieuwoudt confessed earlier this week that Mr Streeting’s latest offer was “generous” – but, he said, not generous enough. The BMA sent out a leaflet to the 50,000 members who will vote on whether they are prepared to take strike action and to further the pay dispute. Half need to reply for it to progress. In the leaflet, a section of frequently asked questions includes one in which junior doctors raise concerns that they are now perceived as greedy by their registrars and consultants. They are now cognisant of the reality that they profited the most in recent years compared to other public sector professions, and are worried about how fresh action would look. And, it seems, the public shares their stance and has a diminishing perception of the strike advocates . Gone is the majority support for them to be paid more, replaced by a sense of fatigue that strikes and withdrawal of care are being used to wring out more money from the taxpayer. More people now oppose strikes than support them, a YouGov poll has found – a profound shift from last year, when more than half of people said they supported the strikes. Now, the resident doctors of DoctorsVote want to strike again. Coordination of industrial action with more senior doctors and specialists could hobble the NHS at skeleton staffing akin to Christmas Day levels. The cost to the NHS of 44 days of strike action last year was around £3 billion, according to the NHS Confederation, and this enormous cost is now also being weaponised by the movement. Dr Ryan told The Sunday Times: “We know how much the strikes last time were disruptive to patient care and the waiting list, but we also know exactly how much they cost the government, and it was more than what it would cost to get to full pay restoration . “Last time we ended up coordinating some action and it was immensely disruptive for patient care, and we can see that on the horizon for this Government too.”",

I’m Nick Vinocur, and we have plenty of news to get through, from nationalist Karol Nawrocki’s narrow win in the Polish presidential election runoff to Ukraine’s daring attack on Russia’s strategic bombers. Plus, we have the latest moves in Europe by Republican Senator Lindsay Graham. Sneak peek: His plan to “change the game” on the war in Ukraine relies heavily on Europe and has already won over a major player: Emmanuel Macron.DRIVING THE DAY: POLISH ELECTION THIS ONE’S GOTTA HURT: In a blow to Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk, nationalist Karol Nawrocki beat his liberal rival Rafał Trzaskowski to win the country’s presidential election. Nawrocki’s win means the Law and Justice party (PiS) will retain a foothold on power in Poland and paves the way for further uneasy cohabitation between a nationalist president and a center-right prime minister.The final results: Nawrocki won 50.89 percent of votes while Trzaskowski got 49.11 percent, per the electoral commission. Wojciech Kość has the full details here.The center doesn’t hold: Nawrocki’s victory breaks a string of wins for pro-EU candidates, after centrist Nicușor Dan beat far-right firebrand George Simion in Romania’s presidential election runoff last month, and the center-right Democratic Alliance won the most votes in Portugal’s snap election.**A message from Connect Europe: Dive into Europe’s digital future at the FT-Connect Europe Forum on 23 September at Sparks in Brussels. Don’t miss this chance to explore how innovation and policy are driving competitiveness and resilience in Europe’s tech landscape: join CEOs, policymakers and tech leaders as they discuss digitalisation, infrastructure, AI and more.**Trump effect 1: Nawrocki, who was backed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration as well as by PiS, has indicated he wants to pull Poland away from the European mainstream in a more populist direction and to block key legislative proposals by the Tusk government, following in the footsteps of the outgoing president, Andrzej Duda.Trump effect 2: Nawrocki managed to eke out the win despite a cascade of revelations about his past including accusations that he helped arrange prostitutes for guests of a luxury hotel while working as a security guard, that he took part in fights as a football hooligan and that he acquired an apartment from a pensioner under questionable circumstances.UKRAINE’S STUNNING DRONE RAID UKRAINE-RUSSIA TALKS KICK OFF AFTER DRONE “PEARL HARBOR”: Ukraine’s peace negotiators are in Istanbul this morning for a second round of direct negotiations with Russia against the backdrop of a devastating — and entirely unprecedented — Ukrainian drone attack on Russia’s strategic bombers.One for the history books: Sweden’s uber-diplomat Carl Bildt said of the daring drone attack that “not even the 007 movies managed to come up with something like this.” And when one starts reading into the details of “Operation Spider’s Web,” it’s hard to argue with him.Blow-by-blow: Per reporting by our Ukraine-based colleague Veronika Melkozerova and other sources, Kyiv had been working for one and a half years on this plan, which involved smuggling dozens of attack drones deep into Russian territory, where they lay dormant in the floorboards of simple wooden houses, waiting for a signal to attack.Trucks of drones: Ukraine then enlisted Russian truck drivers to unknowingly bring the drones close to the airfields where Russia parks its strategic bombers. Activated at a great distance (one of the strikes was in Siberia, more than 4,000 kilometers from Kyiv) using Russian telecoms networks, the FPV drones flew themselves into the fuel tanks of some 40 long-distance bombers — which Moscow had been using for its missile attacks on Ukrainian cities — destroying or seriously damaging over a third of all Russian missile carriers, per media reports.Why it matters: Because of the signal it sends about Ukraine’s “cards” ahead of the Istanbul talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is acceding to Trump’s request to hold the peace talks, even if his counterpart, Vladimir Putin, hasn’t shown much serious interest.At the same time, he’s showing Ukraine has the will and the means to inflict pain on Russia — at a time when Trump seems to be running out of patience with Putin. So even if expectations for these talks are ultra-low (Russia has failed to produce a memo demanded by Trump, but has repeated its maximalist demands, per Reuters), the optics show Ukraine playing by Trump’s rules, and showing strength.The bottom line: Even in an authoritarian state like Russia, sentiment counts. The fact Ukraine was able to pull off a stunt like Operation Spider’s Web might not bend Moscow overnight, but it’s likely to affect morale and perhaps even contribute to a sense that Russia’s war is unwinnable — as the Tet Offensive by North Vietnamese forces against the U.S. and South Vietnam convinced the U.S. public its war was unwinnable in 1968. It’s a highly imperfect comparison (Putin won’t be facing student demonstrations anytime soon), but the optics of a powerful, surprise attack that destabilizes a larger adversary aren’t too far off.US RUSSIA HAWK SEEKS EU ALLIES LINDSEY GRAHAM TOUTS “BONE-CRUSHING” MEASURES AGAINST RUSSIA: Ukraine’s stealth attack coincides with a major diplomatic push by U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and his Democratic counterpart, Richard Blumenthal. The pair huddled with top French officials, including Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, and had a phone call with President Macron, per a readout by the two senators (AP has the details).Macron on board: In their statement, Graham and Blumenthal touted what they called their “bone-crushing Russia sanctions bill” — a plan to impose 500 percent tariffs on Russian exports — and said they’d won Macron’s backing to cap the price of Russian oil.In their words: “President Macron supports lowering the price cap for Russian oil, which will hit Putin in the wallet, and working with his team, he committed to try to deliver a forceful message to China and India regarding their financial backing of Putin’s war,” the statement read. Targeting $45 per barrel: This isn’t the first time Macron has voiced support for lowering the price cap. The Financial Times reported last week that Brussels, along with some of Europe’s biggest countries, was pushing to lower the price cap on Russian oil to $45 per barrel from $60 — a plan that still faced some headwinds from reluctant EU countries.EU high-fives Graham: Asked about the Republican senator’s proposal, a senior EU official texted Playbook: “The Graham plan sends a clear message that the West is ready to impose severe economic and energy sanctions on Russia to end this conflict.”The official went on: “Together, the EU and U.S. can compel Moscow to negotiate seriously ... Let’s cut Putin’s ability to prolong this war by hitting his war chest.”Per Graham and Blumenthal, momentum is now building toward a “game-changing” package of measures against the Russian economy ahead of a G7 meeting in Kananaskis, Canada, on June 17. This would include the U.S. sanctions against Russian exports, the next round of EU sanctions and a lower price cap on Russian oil.Talking a big game: “In the coming weeks, you’re going to see a new game being played,” Graham told my Paris colleague Josh Berlinger and other journalists in the French capital over the weekend. “The world has a ton of cards. America has a good hand vis-à-vis Russia. Europe has a good hand. We just need to play the cards.”In detail: At a swanky hotel in central Paris, the pair laid out their plan — starting with a vote in the U.S. Senate no later than in a “couple of weeks,” according to Graham, followed by a vote in the House of Representatives. The Russia hawks are confident their bill has more than enough support to pass muster in both houses of Congress.Trump-proof: Asked about the risk of a veto by Trump, Blumenthal said the pair had sufficient numbers to override such a move, calling the bill “veto-proof.” He added, “This is not confrontational with the president — exactly the opposite.” Graham said: “I’m trying to help the president. We’re not trying to jam him with it.”Final word: While the U.S. proceeds with tariffs, the pair suggested Europe could move ahead with additional sanctions on Russia, including lowering the price cap on Russian oil and seizing Russia’s frozen assets. He concluded: “I want this summer to be crushing.”CATALAN AMNESTY LAW CATALAN AMNESTY LAW OK’ED: Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez’s controversial move to end legal action against hundreds of Catalan separatists is lawful. That’s what the country’s Constitutional Court will say in three weeks, when its judges issue a ruling on an appeal that thus far stopped the law from going into effect, according to a scoop by El País on Sunday. Background: To remain in power in 2023, Sánchez promised separatist parties that he would issue a blanket amnesty for everyone involved in the failed 2017 Catalan independence bid, Aitor Hernández-Morales writes in to report. Spain’s parliament passed the law last year, but the center-right People’s Party immediately challenged it in the courts. The upcoming ruling will state that the amnesty is consistent with the country’s constitution and therefore legal, the newspaper reports.Does this mean Carles Puigdemont gets to go home? The pro-independence former president of the Catalonia region sought refuge in Belgium following the 2017 referendum and has avoided extradition to Spain since then. Last year, he managed to sneak into Barcelona to give a speech, but skipped back across the border as authorities closed in on him. El País reports that for now, Puigdemont can’t return to Spain a free man because the Supreme Court said allegations he used government money to fund the referendum weren’t covered by the amnesty. Puigdemont has appealed this interpretation, but the Constitutional Court must first address other challenges to the law before ruling on his case.**A fresh chapter for Playbook - the unofficial guide to official Washington.

        "description": "Conservative Karol Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda as Poland's new President.",
        "content": "Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland's presidential election, several reports suggested on Monday citing the final vote count. Nawrocki won 50.89 percent of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, who received 49.11 percent votes. Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on August 6. Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister chosen by the parliament. However, the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and to veto legislation. Who is Karol Nawrocki? Right-wing candidate Nawrocki is a conservative historian and heavyweight boxing champion. He was backed by US President Donald Trump in the presidential elections. He won the polls and is set to become Poland's new President. Nawrocki reportedly received help from the White House, having visited Trump briefly in the Oval Office last month. On a visit to Poland last week, US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem urged Poles to vote for Nawrocki to ensure the country enjoys close ties with Trump. Nawrocki , a 42-year-old former boxer, was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start. The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Donald Tusk. Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland, and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports. ‘Defender of Polish value’: Nawrocki has positioned himself as a defender of traditional Polish values, the Associated Press reported. His supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends, including LGBTQ visibility, have embraced him, viewing him as a reflection of the traditional values they grew up with. Nawrocki's stance on NATO, EU: He opposes NATO membership for Ukraine and positioned himself a sceptical of the EU. Nawrocki's ‘criminal links’: The report further informed that Nawrocki's candidacy was clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and participation in a violent street battle. Nawrocki denies the criminal links but acknowledges having taken part in \"noble\" fights. The revelations have not appeared to dent his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated. Nawrocki's Catholic values: A political newcomer, Nawrocki spent the campaign touting his core Catholic values while railing against migration and the EU’s attempts to fight climate change, Bloomberg reported. 'Nawrocki's win could jeopardize...' : With Nawrocki's win, the agenda of Prime Minister Donald Tusk is at stake. Tusk's coalition had ousted Poland’s nationalists in 2023. Nawrocki's win could jeopardize Tusk’s ambition to return Warsaw to the EU mainstream and maintain bloc funding.",

        "content": "Australians warned to prepare for a huge 'bill explosion' that's about to drive up the price of nearly every essential Milk, butter prices set to increase By STEPHEN JOHNSON, ECONOMICS REPORTER FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA Published: 05:52, 2 June 2025 | Updated: 05:59, 2 June 2025 e-mail View comments Australian consumers are being warned to brace for a bill explosion with the cost of milk, butter, and meat set to rise as dairy farmers battle floods and drought - while power prices continue to soar. Egg prices have already surged by 18.6 per cent during the past year, with the latest natural disasters threatening to revive Australia's cost of living crisis. Last month's flooding on the NSW mid-north coast has particularly decimated dairy milk herds near Taree, Wingham and Gloucester. This is occurring as farmers in Victoria, South Australia , Western Australia and Tasmania battle drought, which is pushing up the price of fodder to feed stock across the country. Joe Bradley, the president of dairy farmers' group eastAUSmilk, told Daily Mail Australia a 10 per cent fall in Australian milk production was likely, as a result of the latest floods in New South Wales and Cyclone Alfred in Queensland in March. This would ultimately hit consumers, and see supermarket prices for a litre of milk climb from $1.55 to levels above $2. 'Prices of dairy and dairy products will have to go up, there's no ifs or buts,' he said. 'Milk has to go up: you can't be paying $1.50 a litre for milk, it has to be two bucks a litre minimum for home brand milk.' Australian consumers are set to pay a lot more for milk and butter as dairy farmers struggle with either floods or drought Last month's flooding on the NSW mid-north coast has particularly decimated dairy milk herds near Taree (pictured), Wingham and Gloucester Eight in 10 dairy farmers are now battling the aftermath of floods or droughts. 'We estimate that between the drought and the floods and Cyclone Alfred, there's probably 80 per cent of the dairy farmers have been affected one way or another,' he said. 'It's got to have an impact and prices for farmers' stuff is going through the roof.' A new wave of natural disasters can lead to more farmers quitting the industry, leading to Australia importing more dairy products. 'The consumer will one day pay for all this, there's no doubt about that,' he said. 'It's just a matter of getting in now and trying to make sure that we have fresh dairy for the next generation. 'I can tell you, if milk keeps getting shorter, dairy products keep getting shorter, it might not be a staple diet anymore - it might be a luxury diet.' Back in 2001, shortly after dairy deregulation, Australia's annual dairy milk production peaked at 11.3billion litres, back when Australia was home to 18.8million people. Egg prices have already surged by 18.6 per cent during the past year, with the latest natural disasters threatening to revive Australia's cost of living crisis (pictured are empty eggs shelves at a Coles on the NSW mid-north coast) Read More Three dead, entire towns underwater and supermarket shelves stripped bare as floods wreak havoc That is estimated to have fallen to 8.2billion litres, as Australia's population has grown to 27.3million. During the past two decades, the number of dairy farmers in NSW and Queensland has also plunged by 85 per cent. 'Once you go out of dairy, you don't come back; milk is getting less, Australia's population is growing,' he said. Australia has also become a net importer of butter - exposing consumers to fluctuations in global demand for the spread with less of it now made locally compared with two decades ago. Michael Harvey, a senior dairy analyst with Rabobank, said higher global butter prices, as a result of problems like blue tongue disease affecting European cattle, could see Australians pay more for butter. 'The reality is it's a record-high butter price we've got at the moment,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'If it remains elevated, there's a chance it will, you'll see retail prices moving higher. 'We actually import more butter now than we did - it's a long-run decline in milk production.' Michael Harvey, a senior dairy analyst with Rabobank, said higher global butter prices, as a result of problems like blue tongue disease affecting European cattle, could see Australians pay more for butter Major dairy processors like Norco, Lactalis and Saputo are publishing farmgate prices on Monday, which will determine what dairy farmers are likely to be paid for their produce at a wholesale level in the year ahead. 'Higher global prices feed through to higher retail prices,' Mr Harvey said. 'It's improving global demand, which means you get higher global prices for dairy which then put upward pressure on local prices whether it's at farmgate or in the wholesale market.' Australian consumers have this year already been dealing with an egg shortage after an outbreak of avian influenza affected egg production in Victorian and NSW. As a result, egg prices soared by 18.6 per cent in the year to April with price statistician Michelle Marquardt blaming the outbreak of avian influenza. 'While annual inflation eased for most food categories in April, egg prices were up by 18.6 per cent in the past 12 months. This comes as supply has been affected by bird flu outbreaks,' she said. Agribusiness giant Elders is also predicting an increase in beef and lamb prices, in the six months to September, as a result of drought conditions in southern Australia. This would reduce the supply of livestock 'following increased de-stocking in dry regions'. Meanwhile, electricity price increases of somewhere between 0.5 per cent and 9.7 per cent can be expected from July 1 by customers on default market offers, the maximum retailers can charge as spelled out by regulators. NSW customers on standing offers face the steepest price growth of between 8.3 per cent to 9.7 per cent, depending on their network area. Residential customers on default plans in southeast Queensland can expect hikes of anywhere between 0.5 per cent and 3.7 per cent, while people in South Australia face rises of 2.3 per cent to 3.2 per cent. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese defended his government's energy policies when asked if households were bearing the financial burden of increased network costs to switch to clean energy Victorian households can expect a modest one per cent average bump, according to the Essential Services Commission. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese defended his government's energy policies when asked if households were bearing the financial burden of increased network costs to switch to clean energy. 'The cheapest form of new energy is renewables, backed by gas, backed by batteries and backed by hydro for firming capacity,' he told reporters. 'That is the transition that is under way. 'And at the election on May 3, there was the option of stopping all of that, waiting until the 2040s for the nuclear fantasy to be rolled out with costs, unknown of that.' Deputy leader of the opposition Ted O'Brien said electricity prices continued to rise despite 'constant assurances of cheaper power from the Albanese government'. 'The AER identifies high demand, network and power station outages and low renewable generation as the key drivers behind the continued rise in prices,' said the former energy spokesman. 'While the opposition acknowledges it did not meet expectations at the recent election the fundamental issues in Australia's energy market under Labor persist - prices continue to rise.'

        "content": "Mongolia has been thrown into fresh political crisis with protesters calling for the resignation of the country’s prime minister over his family’s lavish displays of wealth. For two weeks, young Mongolians have taken to the streets of the capital putting pressure on Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai who will face a vote of confidence in his government on Monday. Democratic Mongolia is a landlocked nation of just 3.5 million people sandwiched between authoritarian giants China and Russia, and the latest political crisis has put renewed scrutiny on the stability of the country’s democracy. Here’s what to know: Luxury car, designer handbags The protests were triggered by social media posts that went viral showing the prime minister’s 23-year-old son’s lavish engagement proposal and their apparent extravagant lifestyle including helicopter-rides, an expensive ring, designer handbags and a luxury car. Suspicion grew over how the son accumulated such wealth – especially as Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene campaigned on being from a rural, not wealthy family. “With no visible sources of income, their display of luxury bags, private travel, and high-end living was a blatant slap in the face to the average Mongolian citizen,” said Amina, 28, a member of protest group Ogtsroh Amarhan (Resigning is Easy). Amina, who wanted to go by one name for security reasons, said the protests go beyond the social media posts flaunting wealth, which she said were symptomatic of a widening disconnect between the ruling elite and everyday people. Deeping the anger is the rising cost of living, soaring inflation in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and choking pollution in the capital that’s home to half the population. “The cost of living in Mongolia has skyrocketed — many people are paying nearly half of their monthly income in taxes while barely making enough to cover food, rent, or utilities. Most are not living paycheck to paycheck anymore — they’re living loan to loan, debt to debt,” she said. Protesters have gathered in the capital Ulaanbaatar’s central Sükhbaatar Square, in front of the Government Palace, almost daily for two weeks, calling for Oyun-Erdene to release his finances and resign. The Prime Minister’s office called the allegations of financial impropriety “completely unfounded.” “The prime minister makes regular financial declarations annually in line with Mongolian law,” the office said in a statement to CNN. Corruption For decades, Mongolia has struggled with endemic graft and protests often break out over allegations that corrupt officials and business leaders were enriching themselves with public funds. Mass protests erupted in 2022 over a corruption scandal involving the alleged embezzlement of billions of dollars’ worth of coal destined for China. Though analysts say there is no evidence of corruption by Oyun-Erdene, his son’s social media posts deepened the frustration of a public long wary of their elected officials misusing public resources. “I want a fair society where ordinary people have a voice, and where government officials are held accountable. Seeing so much inequality, injustice, and arrogance from those in power pushed me to speak up,” said Ariunzaya Khajidmaa, 23, a resident of Ulaanbaatar who joined the protests with her 2-month-old baby. Part of public frustration is that even when corruption cases are prosecuted, they are slow to work their way through the judicial system, leading some to question the independence of the judiciary. The 2024 Freedom House index said “corruption and political influence in the daily work of judges remain concerns.” “If you look at the corruption index, it has gone down. And one explanation is that, even though the Prime Minister has exposed a lot of the corruption cases, nothing has been done. So now everybody’s looking at the judiciary,” said Bolor Lkhaajav, a Mongolian political analyst and commentator. What’s the Prime Minister’s position? The Prime Minister is trying to save his coalition government and parliament, called the State Great Khural, is holding a vote of confidence on Monday. Oyun-Erdene and his son have submitted themselves to Mongolia’s anti-corruption agency and the prime minister said he would resign if the investigation uncovered any irregularities. His Mongolian People’s Party (MPP) is the largest in the 126-seat parliament, holding 68 seats. But complicating the confidence vote is that the ruling coalition appears to be breaking up. The MPP kicked out its junior partner, the Democratic Party – which controls 43 seats – after some of its members supported the protesters. ‘Tip of the iceberg’ The protests are just “the tip of the iceberg,” said Jargalsaikhan Dambadarjaa, a Mongolian broadcaster and political commentator, who pointed to some of the major economic shifts in the country. Oyun-Erdene, who was re-elected to a second term in 2024, had promised to diversify the country’s economy, which is dependent on the mining industry accounting for about a quarter of GDP. Mongolia has huge deposits of coal, copper, gold and phosphorite, and about 90% of Mongolia’s coal exports go to China. Oyun-Erdene’s coalition government last year announced 14 new mega projects to boost economic growth, including cross-border railway connections and a major expansion of renewable energy. And one of Oyun-Erdene’s signature policy centerpieces was establishing a national wealth fund, which the government said aimed to redistribute the country’s assets to the people. The Sovereign Wealth Fund law, approved by parliament in April, allows the government to take a 34% stake in mines considered to have strategic mineral deposits, meaning they are vital for the country’s economy and development. There are currently 16 such sites and the profits will go into the fund, with portions allocated to benefitting Mongolian people including through financial assistance, healthcare, education, and housing, according to public broadcaster Montsame. The move has not sat well with the country’s wealthy and powerful mining elite. “These people, they are now at the edge of losing their power - huge money - which created huge inequality in the country. So they are fighting to the death against this government,” said Jargalsaikhan. A democracy between two autocratic giants Mongolia has been a parliamentary democracy since its democratic revolution in 1991. But the years since have seen multiple governments toppled, or leaders shuffled. This instability has led some Mongolians to believe the powers of President Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, who is head of state, should be extended. Currently, the president can only serve one six-year term. “In this mosaic, those who are supporting presidential power argue that, look at Russia and China, they are one-man presidential powers and they are very stable. They say, we tried this parliamentarian system and it looks like it doesn’t work. That’s their idea,” Jargalsaikhan said. Khurelsukh has repeatedly said he does not want to change Mongolia’s parliamentary democracy. However, some believe amending the constitution to extend presidential term limits is on the table. “It’s a very crucial time, a very delicate time, and it’s another test to our democracy,” said Jargalsaikhan. “Freedom comes only with the parliamentary system... If we don’t do that, we will be another failed economy, a failed nation.” In a statement, the prime minister’s office said, “there has been a deliberate attempt to undermine” the reforms of the coalition government by a “hostile campaign” that would “turn Mongolia away from a parliamentary democracy and return power and wealth to a small group driven by self-interest.” Analysts say Mongolia needs to show it can have stable governance so it can attract broader foreign investment and reduce its economic dependence on China and Russia. Khurelsukh last year welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin for an official visit to Mongolia, a trip condemened by Ukraine . The visit was Putin’s first to a member country of the International Criminal Court which had issued an arrest warrant for Putin on charges on war crimes. “A lot of the governments that are looking at Mongolia as an oasis of democracy between Russia and China, so they want to trust us, but at the same time, you have to show some accountability and stability for other governments to say, okay, Mongolia is getting better,” said Bolor. Those on the streets say they are tired of political games and want to see tangible improvements to their daily lives. “We want stronger anti-corruption measures, public officials who are held to ethical standards, and a system that ensures no one is above the law,” said Ariunzaya. “It’s time for the government to listen to its citizens and take meaningful, lasting action—not just offer words.” CNN’s Alysha Bibi contributed reporting.",

        "description": "Salman Rushdie at the Hay Festival dismissed AI as a real threat to authors, claiming writers are safe until it learns humour. He also spoke about his recovery, new fiction, and why storytelling matters more than ever in today’s divided world.",
        "content": "Salman Rushdie believes authors are still safe from AI — at least until it manages to write something genuinely funny. While speaking at the Hay Festival in Hay-on-Wye, Wales, Rushdie shared that he has “never tried AI” and prefers to pretend it doesn’t exist. Also Read: Salman Rushdie Returns to Fiction with 'The Eleventh Hour' After Near-Fatal Attack in 2022 According to him, AI’s biggest shortcoming is its inability to generate original humour. “It has no sense of humour – you don’t want to hear a joke told by ChatGPT. If there’s a moment when there’s a funny book written by ChatGPT I think we’re screwed,” the author remarked. The event marked Rushdie’s most prominent in-person appearance in the UK since the on-stage stabbing in the US that left him blind in one eye. Due to heightened security concerns, the audience was asked to arrive early. Police officers stood ready in the wings, and security personnel lined both sides of the stage. Rushdie, now 77, expressed relief that his assailant, 27-year-old Hadi Matar, had been found guilty of attempted murder and assault and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Rushdie shared that true closure came from writing about the incident in his book 'Knife: Meditations After An Attempted Murder'. “I’m glad that trial is over and done with. And that he got the maximum sentence. The closure was more finishing writing about it,” he said. He also expressed excitement about releasing new fiction later this year, saying writing it “felt like coming home.” “Ever since the attack, really, the only thing anybody’s wanted to talk to me about is the attack. And I’m over it. It will be nice to have stories to talk about,” he added. Reflecting on his early ambitions, he noted, “When I wanted to be a writer, it never occurred to me that I would write about myself. That seemed like the most uninteresting thing of all. I wanted to make stuff up.” Rushdie also commented on Donald Trump, saying the world was in an “orange moment.” “I don’t know what to do with it – he was elected,” he said, before adding, “So was Hitler, by the way.” Rushdie made the case that in a world where people often couldn’t agree on the truth, stories and fables carried even more weight and at times, could feel more authentic. However, he admitted he didn’t enjoy books that aimed to teach lessons, saying he preferred those he could lose himself in. He joked that most authors don’t earn much, unless they write about “child wizards,” likening J.K. Rowling to “the Taylor Swift of literature.” Rushdie spent years in hiding after the 1988 publication of 'The Satanic Verses', a work of fiction inspired by the life of the Muslim prophet Muhammad, which sparked international outrage and threats to his life. Also Read: Ranking Salman Rushdie's Books From Worst to Best: See Where’s Your Favourite In August 2022, he was attacked while speaking on a stage in New York, sustaining serious injuries that included the loss of vision in one eye, liver damage, and a paralysed hand due to nerve injury. In 'Knife', Rushdie recounts the harrowing events of the attack and its aftermath, recalling how his eye hung from his face like “a large soft-boiled egg,” while also chronicling his journey of healing and recovery.",

The junta initially declared a truce in the many-sided civil war after a huge quake in late March killed nearly 3,800 people and left tens of thousands homeless. The truce has been extended before, although conflict monitors say fighting has continued, including regular air strikes.

It added that the state was “intensively engaging in reconstruction of damaged government offices and departments, public residences and transport facilities”. The ceasefire would also allow the country to hold “a free and fair multi-party democracy general election”, according to the statement. The country’s junta chief said earlier this year that a long-promised election will be held by January, the first in the war-torn nation since the military staged a coup in 2021. In the statement, the military also warned it would still strike back against any offensives by the array of ethnic armed groups and anti-coup fighters.

        "description": "Conservative Karol Nawrocki wins Poland's presidential election",
        "content": "Conservative Karol Nawrocki wins Poland's presidential election (Image: AP) WARSAW: Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland's weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count on Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%. The close race had the country on edge since a first round two weeks earlier and through the night into Monday, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union. An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture hours later. The outcome indicates that Poland can be expected to take a more nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by US President Donald Trump. The role of a president in Poland Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister chosen by the parliament. However, the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and to veto legislation. Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6. A headache for Tusk Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 at the end of a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide - so broad that it hasn't been able to fulfill certain of Tusk's electoral promises, such as loosening the restrictive abortion law. But Duda's veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared to be undemocratic. Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises, which he had made both to voters and to the EU. A former boxer, historian and political novice Nawrocki, a 42-year-old historian, was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start. The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback, and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who would not be burned by the scandals of the party's eight years of rule. Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland, and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports. Nawrocki's supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends, including LGBTQ+ visibility, have embraced him, viewing him as a reflection of the traditional values they grew up with. The Trump factor Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland's president. The conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland last week to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem, the US Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him. The US has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president. A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore \"normality,\" as they believe Trump has done. US flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies, and his supporters believed that he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.",

        "description": "Birmingham residents living in the Selly Oak area recently criticised the council's “blanket acceptance of HMOs”",
        "content": "Birmingham residents living in the Selly Oak area recently criticised the council's “blanket acceptance of HMOs” Selly Oak’s MP has said tackling the ‘brewing problem’ of HMOs and exempt accommodation is one of the key challenges he wants to tackle in the coming years. Al Carns, who became a Birmingham MP during last year’s general election, recently spoke about the “major issue” and what can be done to address it with students from the University of Birmingham . It comes months after angered Brummies living in the constituency criticised the city council’s “blanket acceptance of HMOs” in parts of the area and called for change. READ MORE: How long Birmingham City Council’s ‘long road’ to recovery could be amid 'critical turning point' “It’s a huge, huge burden on the waste issues,” Elsa Ralph, who has lived in the area for nearly three decades, said last summer. “And the rat issue is just horrific - it’s really difficult. Each summer, we look at what we can put [in our garden] that the rats won’t attack.” Another frustrated resident living in the area, who wished to remain anonymous, also told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) at the time that he was worried about the cumulative impact of all of the HMOs and argued that more of a “balance” was needed. “The area is always going to be populated with students. We live next to one of the best universities in the UK,” he said. “The issue isn’t against students. “One more HMO in isolation won’t make an issue but when it’s one more on every road, every month or every six months, that’s 30 new HMOs.\" During his recent meeting at the Guild of Students, Mr Carns acknowledged that Selly Oak has “more exempt housing and HMOs than any other constituency in Birmingham”. “I want to make sure HMO and exempt housing has the right legislative wrap around it to make sure it’s done in the right place, at the right time, at the right speed,” he went on to say. “I think we’re just brewing a real problem there.” Asked what he wanted to achieve over the next four years in Selly Oak, Mr Carns also said: “There’s a couple of big things on the horizon. “One is the life sciences centre - it’s really making sure Birmingham becomes a centre for life sciences between us, Oxford and Cambridge. “We have the most diverse population in the UK, we have the youngest population in the UK. “It’s a perfect sort of ground for effective life science research and development and I want to get the next building moving. “That’s in excess of three thousand jobs, probably another three thousand jobs after that - I think that’s critical for Selly Oak.” “I want to get the services improved,” he added. “I mean bins but also the collective services across Selly Oak as a whole.” Last year, Birmingham City Council was asked about residents’ concerns over HMOs and exempt accommodation in the Selly Oak constituency. Coun Majid Mahmood, the council's cabinet member for environment , told the LDRS that they understand the concerns of local residents about issues relating to the \"street scene\" in their part of Selly Oak. “First and foremost, we cannot lose sight of the fact that everyone living or operating a business in any area has a personal responsibility to respect their local environment,\" he said. \"The majority of the people in Selly Oak look after their environment for which many thanks. “We know of many good people who litterpick and report environmental issues. If everyone did this, we would not witness the many issues that are being experienced in this case.\" READ MORE: Fight against controversial Birmingham park proposals escalates However, he continued that it was right that the council \"also has a part to play too\". \"The councillors for the area, for a very long time, have worked hard to engage with the community and stakeholders such as the Student Guild,\" he said. “Our waste management team has also carried out various activities in the area in an attempt to encourage the positive behaviours that would end the local issues. “Existing regulations relating to HMOs can also play a part with such issues, and where we have evidence of waste offences that meet the legally-required threshold, we will not hesitate to prosecute – as evidenced by a range of cases in the past across Birmingham – but we need conclusive evidence and/or witnesses willing to come forward to do this.\" He added: “A Public Space Protection Order (PSPO) remains a potential option but has to be a last resort when all other options are exhausted. “We will keep the situation under review but believe the other actions and options that are being followed, finalised or are already available need to be given a chance to have an impact before an order is considered.”",

        "description": "Poland’s Presidential Candidates Neck-and-Neck, Exit Polls Show",
        "content": "A nationalist candidate backed by Donald Trump won Poland's presidential election, defeating the centrist mayor of Warsaw in a blow to the country's pro-European Union government. Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian and former boxer, won 50.9per cent, while Rafal Trzaskowski took 49.1per cent, according to Bloomberg News calculations based on data from 100per cent of precincts reported by the electoral commission. In months of campaigning, the nationalist managed to close what had been a formidable lead by Trzaskowski in polls. The ballot is likely to determine whether one of the EU's fastest-growing economies and one of NATO's biggest defense spenders remains a reliable partner within the 27-member bloc, which is under mounting pressure from Trump's tariffs and Russia's threat to the east. The narrow margin laid bare the polarization that's gripped the nation of 37 million, with issues such as migration, abortion and European integration sharply dividing voters. Nawrocki dismissed an early exit poll that showed Trzaskowski in the lead. \"We will wake up tomorrow with President Karol Nawrocki,\" the nationalist told supporters soon after polls closed on Sunday. Nawrocki received help from the White House, having visited Trump briefly in the Oval Office last month. On a visit to Poland last week, US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem urged Poles to vote for Nawrocki to ensure the country enjoys close ties with Trump. At stake is the agenda of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose coalition ousted Poland's nationalists in 2023. Their eight years in power brought scrutiny from Brussels over the rule of law and raised questions about the nation's allegiance to the liberal West. A Nawrocki win could jeopardize Tusk's ambition to return Warsaw to the EU mainstream and maintain bloc funding. Tusk's program has been stalled by outgoing President Andrzej Duda, a nationalist ally. Nawrocki told his supporters that his victory would amount to a check on Tusk's \"monopoly\" on power, which \"takes away our great dreams and takes away our aspirations.\" The vote had effectively become a referendum on Poland's future, including its role in Europe, women's rights, national identity and assistance to neighboring Ukraine. The two candidates encapsulated the nation's divide: Trzaskowski, the polyglot son of a jazz musician, against Nawrocki, who heads the Institute for National Remembrance, which investigates Nazi and communist-era crimes. A political newcomer, Nawrocki spent the campaign touting his core Catholic values while railing against migration and the EU's attempts to fight climate change. His campaign was dogged by allegations over a property purchase from an elderly seller and his participation in arranged fights between soccer hooligans. The turnout was 71.3per cent, compared with a record 74.4per cent during parliamentary elections two years ago and 68.2per cent in the last presidential runoff in 2020. While political power is held by the prime minister, Poland's president can veto legislation, nominates the central bank governor and leads the country's armed forces. The head of state is elected to a five-year term and is limited to two terms. The ballot could expose further cracks in Tusk's coalition and energize Nawrocki's backers in the populist the Law & Justice party as well as surging far-right factions ahead of the 2027 parliamentary elections. It's also a reality check for revved-up Polish assets, which have broadly rallied since Tusk's alliance won power two years ago. Warsaw's WIG20 stock index jumped 61per cent in dollar terms since the last parliamentary election, while government bonds returned 28per cent, most among emerging markets after South Africa and Thailand. While Tusk is admired abroad as the man who took on populism and won, his popularity at home has been waning because of disillusionment over his ability to deliver.",

DW has more What you need to know Poles were choosing between Warsaw's pro-EU mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki Trzaskowski narrowly won the first round of voting on May 18 The result could have major implications for Poland, a NATO and European Union member Polish presidents can veto government bills and are also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces Here's the latest news and updates on Poland's presidential runoff on June 1, 2025: Nawrocki wins Poland's presidential election — official results Polish conservative Karol Nawrocki won the run-off election for the presidency against liberal rival Rafal Trzaskowski, official results showed. The National Election Commission said Nawrocki won 50.89% against 49.11% for Trzaskowski. Nawrocki set for narrow win: reports According to Polish media reports, the conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki has won the run-off election for president. Major Polish media outlets such as the newspaper Rzeczpospolita and the news portal Onet.pl based this on the count of more than 99% of the votes by the Polish National Electoral Commission. Nawrocki secured 50.89% of the vote, while Trzaskowski received 49.11%, they said. The Electoral Commission said on its website that it had counted all of the votes and would officially announce the results later on Monday. Poland's president mainly has a ceremonial role. However, the president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, can veto government bills, has a right to a say in the country's foreign policy and can propose new legislation. Donald Tusk's pro-EU coalition government attempts at reform have been blocked several times by current conservative incumbent president, Andrzej Duda. Nawrocki seen narrowly ahead in exit poll A late exit poll by Ipsos for broadcasters TVN, TVP and Polsat showed conservative historian Karol Nawrocki at 50.7%, and his rival, liberal Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, at 49.3%. It overturned the result of an earlier exit poll by Ipsos, published just after voting ended, which had put the 53-year-old Trzaskowski ahead with 50.3% against 49.7% for the 42-year-old Nawrocki. The polls have a margin of error and it was still not clear who the winner was. Election officials forecast that the final result will only be known early on Monday.

Nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, who was on 49.7 percent, told his supporters: \"Tonight we will win. We will win and we will save Poland.\" The forecasts were based on exit polls conducted in around 500 polling stations and have a margin of error of two percentage points. The official final result is expected on Monday. Exit poll in Poland's presidential runoff is too close to call As polls closed in Poland's presidential runoff election, exit polls were too close to predict who might come out on top. An Ipsos exit poll predicted that liberal Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski won 50.3% of the vote and conservative historian Karol Nawrocki won 49.7%. Trzaskowsk is claiming he won the second round of the election. Voter turnout appeared to be high with at least 54.91% of eligible voters casting their ballots by late Sunday afternoon, according to the electoral commission in Warsaw. DW asks: What do Poles expect of their next president? From local policies, working with parliament and the war in Ukraine, there's much at stake in the second round of the presidential elections in Poland. DW asked people in Warsaw what kind of president they are hoping for. What do Poles expect of their next president?

Both candidates have cast their votes The two presidential hopefuls in Poland's runoff vote cast their ballots on Sunday. Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski posted a photo with his wife Malgorzata Trzaskowska on X, calling on Poles to head out and vote. \"Polling stations are open until 9 pm!\" he wrote. Trzaskowski's rival, Karol Nawrocki, also posted \"Long Live Poland,\" accompanied by a photo with his family. Who are the candidates? Poland 's presidential runoff has boiled down to a radically different ideological choice: a pro-European liberal versus a staunch nationalist. Rafal Trzaskowski is backed by the governing Civic Coalition party of Prime Minister Donald Tusk , a former European Council president. He was elected mayor of Warsaw in 2018 and re-elected in 2024. A former deputy foreign minister, the 53-year-old has promised to soften Poland's near-total abortion ban and protect LGBTQ rights. His victory would allow Tusk to push ahead with his reformist agenda. In 2020, Trzaskowski narrowly lost his first presidential bid to incumbent Andrzej Duda, who is finishing his second and final term . This time around, the race is expected to be even tighter. The Warsaw mayor is pitted against Karol Nawrocki, a historian endorsed by Duda who has blocked several laws with his veto power. The 42-year-old has positioned himself as a defender of traditional Polish values. He campaigned under the slogan \"Poland first, Poles first.\" Nawrocki, an admirer of US President Donald Trump, is skeptical of the EU. His win would be a major boost for the opposition Law and Justice party, which governed Poland between 2015 and 2023. His supporters want stricter curbs on immigration. Nawrocki has called for border controls with Germany to keep out migrants. Polls open as voting gets underway Polling stations have opened across Poland in the closely fought presidential runoff. It follows a first round on May 18, in which Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski won by a razor-thin margin. Trzaskowski earned just over 31% against nearly 30% for Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian. Eleven other candidates were eliminated. Voting will end at 9:00 pm (1900 GMT) when exit polls are expected to come out. Final results are likely to be announced on Monday. WATCH — What's at stake in Poland's presidential election?

        "description": "Nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, who is predicted to have won Sunday's presidential election in Poland, is a former amateur boxer with a particular interest in the criminal underworld.",
        "content": "Nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, who is predicted to have won Sunday's presidential election in Poland, is a former amateur boxer with a particular interest in the criminal underworld. The 42-year-old Nawrocki has been endorsed by the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, which governed Poland from 2015 to 2023. The party is closely allied with outgoing President Andrzej Duda -- who has publicly backed Nawrocki -- and is a long-standing rival of the ruling Civic Coalition. Nawrocki campaigned under the slogan \"Poland first, Poles first\". While he has pledged to continue Poland's support for neighbouring Ukraine against Russia's invasion, he has denounced the benefits given to war refugees. He said in a campaign video in April that \"social benefits will be above all for Poles\" and that \"in queues for doctors and clinics, Polish citizens must have priority\". In May, he claimed Ukraine \"has not shown gratitude for what Poles have done\" and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of \"insolence\". He opposes Ukraine's bid to join NATO. Nawrocki is an admirer of Donald Trump and has said Poland should focus on shaping and leading Europe's relations with the US president. Nawrocki met Trump at the White House in May and claimed Trump had told him: \"You will win\". The two were shown giving a thumbs up in photos released by the White House. Some lawmakers from the governing coalition accused Trump of election interference. US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem also endorsed Nawrocki when she attended a conservative conference in Poland, saying: \"He needs to be the next president.\" Nawrocki has called for controls on the border with Germany to keep out migrants, and would like Berlin to pay wartime reparations to Poland. While wooing voters during the campaign, Nawrocki signed an eight-point pledge prepared by far-right leader Slawomir Mentzen. The election campaign also saw Nawrocki embroiled in a series of scandals. While arguing against a property tax, he claimed to only own one flat. Later it was revealed he had acquired a second one through a convoluted deal with an elderly man. A bombshell news report also alleged he had arranged prostitutes for guests while working as a hotel security guard. Nawrocki called the accusations \"a bunch of lies\" and said he would sue the news site. Born in the Baltic port city of Gdansk, Nawrocki boxed and played football in his youth before earning a PhD in history and an MBA. He served as the director of the World War II museum in Gdansk from 2017 to 2021. Since then, he has led the Institute of National Remembrance, which investigates Nazi and communist-era crimes. His research focused on Poland's anti-communist opposition, organised crime during the communist era and sports history. Last year, Russia added Nawrocki to its wanted list for his alleged efforts to remove Soviet-era monuments in Poland. Nawrocki said he obtained a gun licence and firearm after winding up in Russia's crosshairs. Nawrocki has written several books, including one under a pen name that landed him in an unusual controversy. In 2018, he secretly published a book about the communist-era gangster Nikodem Skotarczak using the pseudonym Tadeusz Batyr. That same year, a blurred and voice-altered \"Batyr\" appeared on state television claiming Nawrocki had inspired the book. Nawrocki later wrote on social media that Batyr had sought his advice and \"thanked me with an interesting book, which I recommend\". But local media recently uncovered that Batyr and Nawrocki were one and the same. Political opponents seized on the revelation. Nawrocki has also faced accusations of ties to gangsters and neo-Nazis, which he has rejected as \"deep manipulation\", insisting his contacts were for professional purposes. \"No one has ever heard a good word from me about Nazism,\" he said. Nawrocki speaks English and still boxes in his spare time. He has said Poland needs \"a strong president for tough times\". He lives with his wife, Marta, and has two children and an adult stepson.

        "content": "Observers say that Lee, if elected, will walk a tightrope between an increasingly “critical” Washington over Seoul’s part in defence-sharing, while softening the conservatives’ hardline stance on Beijing and avoiding any part in a possible war over Taiwan. Lee said last week that the 28,500 US soldiers stationed in South Korea play a “very important role in the United States’ containment policy against China” amid talks of a troop drawdown and reassignment elsewhere. In response to a question about whether he would help Taiwan repel an invasion from mainland China, he sidestepped the issue, saying: “I’ll think about that when aliens try to invade Earth.” Beijing sees Taiwan as part of China, to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington opposes any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons.",

        "content": "Aam Aadmi Party MP Dr Ashok Kumar Mittal accused Pakistan of being involved in every terrorist incident in the world. All-party delegations attending diplomatic engagements in Spain on Sunday conveyed a unified stance against terrorism and asserted that Pakistan has hand in every terrorist incident in the world. Addressing the Indian community in Madrid on Sunday, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Dr Ashok Kumar Mittal accused Pakistan of being involved in every terrorist incident in the world. \"Be it the UK or even France, Pakistan has a hand in every terrorist incident in the world. Prime Minister Modi believes in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. We want peace, we want to grow and let others grow as well,\" ANI quoted Mittal as saying. BJP MP Captain Brijesh Chauta (Retd) cautioned the international community against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, saying today India is its victim, tomorrow the whole world will be its victim. \"It is Pakistan's state-sponsored terrorism that different nations need to understand. Today, we might be the victims of it; tomorrow, the world will be a victim of it. Many nations tell us that India should sit and talk. Who to talk to is the question. Do we talk to the elected government in Pakistan? If there is one? Do we talk to the army there? Do we talk to the Islamic clergy?\" Chauta said. DMK MP Kanimozhi stressed the complexity involved in resolving conflicts with Pakistan, saying that the issue between the two countries cannot be resolved just by talks. \"The Government of India has sent out delegations, and we've also reached out to friendly nations and nations which have some misconceptions that we can resolve issues just by speaking to them and calling Pakistan over for a coffee and saying we will resolve these conflicts. It's much more than what meets the eye for many people,\" Kanimozhi said. Gurdaspur-born Senator from Barcelona, Robert Masih Nahar, praised India’s firm response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack through ‘Operation Sindoor’, terming it a “good step.” \"The government should have done this earlier. We tolerated them for long, we tried to make them understand, but there has to be a day when India had to teach them that it will not tolerate any terrorist attack. It was a good step by India. A terrorist country and those who are running it must get a message that they will get a befitting reply. All the countries are against terrorism. The delegations will talk to the government here, and I think they will get this assurance that Spain is with India,\" Nahar said. Pahalgam To Operation Sindoor On April 22, twenty-six innocent civilians were killed, and several others were injured by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir. In response to this terror attack, the Indian Armed Forces launched Operation Sindoor on May 7. This decisive military action targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. As a result, over 100 terrorists affiliated with groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen were eliminated, highlighting India’s commitment to countering terrorism with strong measures.

        "description": "Beijing has firmly denied claims by US President Donald Trump that it violated a Geneva trade tariff agreement, calling the accusations \"unreasonable\" and urging Washington to correct its \"wrongful actions\" to maintain diplomatic consensus. The dispute underscores the fragile state of US-China economic ties, already strained by tech export restrictions and visa cancellations.",
        "content": "In a sharp rebuttal, China on Monday rejected accusations from US President Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that it violated a 90-day tariff reduction agreement reached in Geneva. The dispute underscores the fragile state of US-China economic ties, already strained by tech export restrictions and visa cancellations, said a TOI report. Responding to Lutnick’s remarks on Fox News Sunday accusing Beijing of “slow-rolling the deal”, China’s commerce ministry issued a strongly worded statement: “The US has made bogus charges and unreasonably accused China of violating the consensus, which is seriously contrary to the facts. China firmly rejects these unreasonable accusations.” The temporary Geneva agreement, formed last month during talks between senior officials from both sides, aimed to de-escalate tensions by reducing high tariffs. However, President Trump escalated matters last week by stating that China had “totally violated” the agreement, without offering specific evidence. In its response, Beijing stressed that it has “been firm in safeguarding its rights and interests, and sincere in implementing the consensus.” The Chinese commerce ministry further criticised Washington for introducing “discriminatory restrictive measures” including AI chip export bans and the revocation of Chinese student visas, which it said undermined trust and cooperation. “We urge the US to meet China halfway, immediately correct its wrongful actions, and jointly uphold the consensus from the Geneva trade talks,” the ministry stated, adding that China “will continue to resolutely take strong measures to uphold its legitimate rights and interests” if tensions escalate further. This latest exchange follows several years of fluctuating relations between the world’s two largest economies. Analysts believe that ongoing geopolitical shifts, election-year politics in the US, and competition in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors are intensifying the divide. While US officials have not publicly detailed how China may have violated the Geneva agreement, trade observers suggest Washington may be referring to delayed tariff rollbacks or inconsistent customs enforcement on key American imports. There has been no official comment yet from the World Trade Organization (WTO) or any Geneva-based trade monitoring body regarding the implementation of the deal. Despite the flare-up, diplomats in both capitals privately suggest that dialogue remains open, and a trade delegation from Washington is expected to visit Beijing later this month for further discussions.

It was not the BJP that built the flyover on Tumkur Road, Airport Road, Hosur Road and Kolar Road. It was the Manmohan Singh government that granted these projects,\" Shivakumar said.\"We have formed the Greater Bengaluru Authority to cater to the needs of the growing city. After a meeting with the MLAs and ministers, we will decide the number of corporations. We will hold elections once the corporations are formed,\" he added.Talking about the promise of delivering on the guarantee schemes, an election promise of the party, Shivakumar added, \"When I took oath as the KPCC President, I had said that the Congress party will come to power if the youth and women of the state make up their mind. We came to power, and we decided to repay their debt through five guarantee schemes. Our government has delivered as promised.\" Hitting out at the BJP, Shivakumar said that the opposing party is \"about more noise and little action.\" \"The BJP was in power in the state before us for 4 years, yet never came up with any schemes like guarantee schemes. BJP is about more noise and little action. Our candidate Manjanna had lost the election here, yet he has got e-khatha done for 8,000 families,\" he said. Earlier today, Shivakumar also highlighted the Express Link Canal project, saying that the project would continue despite protests. He said that 40 per cent of the work had already been completed, and there was no reason to halt the project at this stage.He said, \"Forty per cent of the work of the Express Link Canal project has been completed. In this situation, there is no reason to stop the work,\" Shivakumar told reporters at Vidhana Soudha while addressing concerns over the Hemavati Link Canal project.\"",

        "content": "Donald Trump's Treasury secretary has the last laugh as he tears apart CBS host's question on inflation By JAMES GORDON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM Published: 05:09 BST, 2 June 2025 | Updated: 05:11 BST, 2 June 2025 e-mail View comments Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared to dismantle a seasoned CBS anchor's prior warnings about inflation during a national TV interview on Sunday, brushing aside months of skepticism on Trump's economic policies. Appearing on Face the Nation, Bessent faced questions from anchor Margaret Brennan about the Trump tariffs and their threat to Americans' wallets. Brennan had posed similar questions months earlier as she told how economists were forecasting prices to skyrocket and inflation to surge. But during Sunday's interview, Bessent gleefully appeared to bat such concerns away. 'Margaret, when we were here in March, you said there was going to be big inflation. There hasn't been any inflation,' Bessent fired back, smirking. Bessent took what many are calling a victory lap after the Labor Department reported that consumer price increases had cooled to its lowest level in over four years. The consumer price index showed a mere 2.3% year-over-year rise for April, down from 2.4% in March - a stunning development considering the alarm bells economists had sounded when Donald Trump rolled out his aggressive new tariffs earlier in April Bessent's smirk at the low inflation figures said it all. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent smugly brushed aside warnings about inflation and months of skepticism on Trump's economic policies. Appearing on Face the Nation Sunday, Bessent faced questions from anchor Margaret Brennan about the Trump tariffs and their threat to American's wallets Months earlier Brennan had pressed him hard about warnings from institutions like the Peterson Institute, which predicted Trump's tariffs would ignite runaway inflation. But on Sunday Bessent managed to turn the tables. 'Actually, the inflation numbers are the best in four years. So why don't we stop trying to say this could happen, and wait and see what does happen,' Bessent said. Bessent calmly brushed aside a reference to a Wall Street Journal column by Republican strategist Karl Rove warning how tariffs could damage the GOP's prospects in the next election. Citing a South China Morning Post report, Bessent told how Chinese suppliers are now eating up to 66% of the tariff burden, blunting the effect on US consumers. 'What we are trying to do is to de-risk,' he explained. 'We do not want to decouple, Margaret, but we do need to de-risk.' His remarks reflect a broader shift in the Trump administration's trade policy - an effort to reduce reliance on China for critical industries like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. 'What China is doing is they are holding back products that are essential for the industrial supply chains of India, of Europe, and that is not what a reliable partner does,' Bessent said. Bessent appeared to take a victory lap after the Labor Department reported that consumer price increases had cooled to its lowest level in over four years Markets were plunged into turmoil following Trump's 'Liberation Day' in April when he revealed tariffs towards almost every country on the planet Pressed on the risks of escalating trade tensions, Bessent was unflinching. Last week, he acknowledged that talks with China had 'been a bit stalled,' but added that the White House remains confident that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will soon iron out their differences with the expectation being the two leaders will speak directly. On the looming issue of the US debt ceiling, Bessent was equally blunt. 'The United States of America is never going to default. That is never going to happen. We are on the warning track and we will never hit the wall,' he said. Bessent also took aim at Wall Street's warnings, brushing off JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's prediction of a bond market crisis. 'I've known Jamie for a long time, and for his entire career he's made predictions like this. Fortunately none of them have come true. That's why he's a great banker - he tries to look around the corner,' Bessent quipped. On tariffs, Bessent remained bullish, despite concerns about their impact on industries like construction. 'So is it going to impact the construction industry? Maybe,' Bessent conceded. 'But it's going to impact the steel industry in a great way.'

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Commission on Elections (Comelec) has lifted the suspension of the proclamation of lawyer Jeryll Harold Respicio, who won the vice mayoral race in Reina Mercedes, Isabela. In an order dated and released on Monday, the Comelec’s First Division lifted the May 12 suspension order against Respicio. “After due deliberation and in consonance with the thrust of the Government to deliver basic and vital services, but without prejudice to the resolution of this matter on the merits, the Order of the Commission (First Division) dated 12 May 2025, insofar as the Respondent Jeryll Harold Paz Respicio is concerned, is hereby LIFTED, effective immediately,” the document reads. Comelec also directed the Reina Mercedes municipal board of canvassers to reconvene within five days from the receipt of the order in line with the proclamation of Respicio. Based on reports, Respicio is a staunch critic of Comelec’s automated election system. Before Comelec ordered the suspension of his proclamation, Respicio faced a disqualification case filed by the Comelec’s Task Force Katotohanan, Katapatan, at Katarungan (KKK) sa Halalan for posting videos online wherein he claimed Comelec’s automated counting machines could be hacked to send fake election results.

        "content": "As Oklahoman legislators push to restrict trans rights and overturn the 2015 Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage, Zane Eaves says his identity as a transgender man has put a target on his back in his home state. One of 18,900 trans adults in Oklahoma, Eaves has received death threats as has his wife of 10 years and their two children. “All the hatred and political stuff going on” are driving this Oklahoma lifer from the place he was born and raised, Eaves, 35, said. He has only crossed the state line three times in his life, but in recent weeks, he made the difficult decision to move his family to North Carolina to be closer to friends and allies. “I am just trying to stay alive and keep my marriage,” Eaves said. Oklahoma ranks 44th in the nation on a list released Monday of the most and least welcoming states for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer Americans. More and more, the question of where LGBTQ+ people feel safe is one of blue vs. red , according to advocacy group Out Leadership. LGBTQ+ equality fell across the board for the third straight year, according to Out Leadership’s State LGBTQ+ Business Climate Index shared exclusively with USA TODAY. But the sharpest declines came in Republican-led states. While progressive strongholds championed supportive policies and protections, conservative states elected a slate of leaders who openly oppose gay and trans rights and sponsored an unprecedented wave of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, Out Leadership CEO and founder Todd Sears said. So-called “Don’t Say Gay” bills, religious exemptions and other legislation tanked the rankings of 19 red states in the Out Leadership index, according to Sears. Today, the divide between states that roll out the welcome mat and less hospitable parts of the country is wider than ever, he said. The least and most welcoming LGBTQ+ states Each year for the last seven, Out Leadership has released the State LGBTQ+ Business Climate Index to gauge the overall climate for gay and transgender people state by state, mapping out where they will face the most and the least discrimination and hardship. Out Leadership’s index measures the impact of state government policies and prevalent attitudes about the LGBTQ+ community, weighing factors such as support for young people and families, health access and safety, political and religious attitudes, work environment and employment and nondiscrimination protections. The Northeast had six of the 10 highest-ranked states, while the Southeast had six of the lowest-ranked. Massachusetts, led by the nation’s first openly lesbian governor, Democrat Maura Healey and New York, which guaranteed gender-affirming care and LGBTQ+ refugee protections, tied for first place in this year’s index, with Connecticut and New Jersey close behind. The least LGBTQ+ friendly state was Arkansas, which ranked last for the third straight year. South Carolina, Louisiana, South Dakota and Alabama also received low scores. The states that had the largest gains in the index were Kentucky and Michigan, which Out Leadership attributed to “pro-equality” leadership from governors Andy Beshear and Gretchen Whitmer, both Democrats. The steepest declines were in Ohio, Florida and Utah, all led by Republican governors. Where are the safest places to live? The Out Leadership index was created as a LGBTQ+ inclusion reference guide for business leaders. But gay and trans people soon began using it to figure out where they should – and should not – live and work, never more so than now as rights rollbacks from the Trump administration and red statehouses hit close to home. Opposition to transgender rights was a central plank in Trump’s presidential campaign and since taking office he has signed a series of executive orders recognizing only male and female genders, keeping trans athletes out of women’s sports, banning trans people from serving in the military and restricting federal funding for gender-affirming care for trans people under age 19. Even states seen as safer for LGBTQ+ people have been navigating these edicts around trans athletes. Trump threatened to cut federal funding to California if a trans girl competed in a state track and field event held Saturday. AB Hernandez, a junior from Jurupa Valley High School in Riverside County, shared first place in the high jump and triple jump and second in the long jump. She shared the awards podium with her cisgender competitors under a new rule drafted by state athletics officials days before the event to mollify critics. Republican-led states have been in the vanguard of anti-trans legislation, causing greater geographic polarization and prompting fears among LGBTQ+ residents, even those who live in liberal cities. Jordan McGuire, a 27-year-old gay man in North Dakota, said the years he spent living in the Deep South taught him about the repressive discrimination routinely faced by gay and genderqueer people. At the same time, socially progressive cities in conservative states like Fargo and Grand Forks are no longer the safe havens they once were, he said. Now that his fiancee is transitioning to female, the couple is exploring a move to a “sanctuary” state that will be safer for them. “It feels like five or 10 years ago, trans people were not under the same microscope they are now and that has definitely influenced our move,” McGuire said. “Yeah, people were prejudiced but it wasn’t a witch hunt. They weren’t looking for people in bathrooms and schools. But now things are so polarized.” That rising anxiety was captured in a post-election survey from UCLA’s Williams Institute which found that nearly half of transgender people had already fled unsupportive communities and nearly 1 in 4 were considering uprooting their lives. The most frequently cited reasons for wanting to move were concerns about LGBTQ+ rights – 76% – the sociopolitical climate – 71% – anti-trans rhetoric and climate – 60% – and anti-trans laws and policies – 47%. LGBTQ+ Americans on the move Interest in relocating to friendlier states is even higher today than it was after Trump’s reelection, say nonprofit workers who aid trans and gender-diverse people relocate to more liberal states with broader protections. So far in 2025, Rainbow Railroad in Canada has received more than 3,000 requests from LGBTQ+ people living in the United States, up more than 1,000% from the same time last year, according to communications director Timothy Chan. Nearly all requested international relocation support. For now, Rainbow Railroad can’t aid Americans with resettlement services because of immigration restrictions, Chan said. TRACTION has heard from a record number of people from states as far away as Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas with many of them reporting being threatened or feeling unsafe in their homes and neighborhoods, said Michael Woodward, the executive director of the trans-led organization in Washington state. Trans and gender-diverse people historically face financial hardship due to systemic oppression and discrimination, and need assistance finding jobs and housing as well as with interstate moving expenses that can run tens of thousands, Woodward said. TRACTION used to get a few applications a week until Trump won a second term. In the two weeks following the election, “we received as many requests for assistance as we’d received in the entire life of the project thus far,” he said. After the inauguration, TRACTION started getting three to five applications every day. With one employee and a handful of volunteers, his organization is struggling to keep up with demand, Woodward said.",

        "description": "The longtime NBC News journalist reflects on how far women have come in the field The post Andrea Mitchell Accepts Career Achievement Award at 85th Peabody Awards appeared first on TheWrap.",
        "content": "NBC News chief Washington and chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell received a Career Achievement Award at the 85th Peabody Awards Sunday. In her remarks, Mitchell reflected on her career and the importance of having “women at every level” in journalism — women who are “smarter, stronger, and more fearless than we ever were – and more empowered” than ever before. Mitchell was announced as the award winner in April . The list of past honorees includes Mel Brooks, Lily Tomlin, Rita Moreno, Dan Rather, Cicely Tyson and Carol Burnett. She has been with NBC News for nearly five decades and has spent three of those serving as the netowrk’s chief foreign affairs correspondent. She previously won a Peabody Award for her coverage of the Texas abortion ban and was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Television Academy at the news and documentary Emmy Awards in 2019. Mitchell’s remarks in full are below: “Winning this award this year along with my NBC colleagues at SNL clearly shows that Peabody recognizes – people need some good laughs along with their news.” “In all seriousness, this award means the world to me – not just for what it says about my work, but for what it represents about the importance of journalism.” “It’s been a long journey for women in my profession. Consider this: my first job in a Philadelphia newsroom was as a ‘copy boy.’ That tells you how rare it was for a woman to be in the room at all, even doing an entry level job.” “There weren’t many women role models in television news back then. I had to fight my way in – and then fight for every promotion after that. I’ve been thrown out of many venues – from Philadelphia’s city hall to the state house in Harrisburg, to the oval office – for asking uncomfortable questions – to the campaign trail with what was then famously called by author Timothy Crouse, ‘the boys on the bus.’ Covering foreign policy, I’ve even been physically dragged out of rooms for challenging dictators in places like Damascus and Sudan. What I learned over the years is that if you don’t keep trying, you’ll never get any answers.” “Women journalists have certainly come a great distance since those early days. When I look across our newsroom now, I see women at every level – as the President and Executive Vice Presidents of NBC News – as our Washington Bureau Chief – women producers, editors, camera crews, researchers and desk assistants. And no, they are no longer called ‘copy boys.'” “I am grateful that many of these terrific journalists worked on my team and have since risen through the ranks to leadership positions. Mentoring the next generations of female journalists has been one of the great joys of my career. And I can tell you, the women journalists of today are smarter, stronger, and more fearless than we ever were – and more empowered.” “And all of us journalists have to be fearless. It is no exaggeration to say that strong journalism, providing accurate information to the American people, is critical to the survival of our democracy. As Thomas Jefferson wrote to the continental Congress in 1787, ‘were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.'” “Whether it is warning communities about an approaching hurricane or informing them about how their elected leaders are responding to an overseas crisis, the work correspondents, producers and photographers do every day saves lives. Literally.” “So thank you, Peabody and the University of Georgia, for respecting journalism and recognizing the importance of what we do. Thank you for honoring a former ‘copy boy’ who has never lost her love of chasing after the next story. Thank you to my wonderful husband for his enduring patience with my erratic work life for all these years – and my eternal gratitude to my NBC family, past and present, for believing in me. This award is for all of them.” The post Andrea Mitchell Accepts Career Achievement Award at 85th Peabody Awards appeared first on TheWrap .",

        "description": "Indian parliamentarians in Madrid conveyed a strong, unified message on India-Pakistan relations and the global fight against terrorism, urging international solidarity. They highlighted the complexities of resolving conflicts with Pakistan, emphasising its involvement in global terrorism and recounting historical aggression.",
        "content": "Indian parliamentarians attending diplomatic engagements in Madrid conveyed a unified and strong stance on India-Pakistan relations and the global fight against terrorism, urging international solidarity with India's position.DMK MP Kanimozhi underlined the complexity involved in resolving conflicts with Pakistan, stating, The Government of India has sent out delegations, and we've also reached out to friendly nations and nations which have some misconceptions that we can resolve issues just by speaking to them and calling Pakistan over for a coffee and saying we will resolve these conflicts. It's much more than what meets the eye for many people. Her remarks highlighted the challenges India faces in addressing Pakistan's role in regional tensions.Supporting this perspective, AAP MP Dr. Ashok Kumar Mittal emphasised Pakistan's pervasive involvement in terrorism worldwide. He said, Be it the UK or even France, Pakistan has a hand in every terrorist incident in the world... Prime Minister Modi believes in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. We want peace, we want to grow and let others grow as well. This sentiment echoed the need for global cooperation to curb terrorism.Recounting historical aggression, Samajwadi Party MP Rajeev Rai pointed to Pakistan's violent past, reminding that Pakistan was born in 1947... They attacked Kashmir, and then they attacked India in 1965. Nowhere in the world you will see that an Army butchered, killed and raped its own women and people - Pakistan did it in East Pakistan which is now Bangladesh. His statement reflected longstanding mistrust rooted in past conflicts.BJP MP Capt Brijesh Chowta (Retd) further condemned Pakistan's state-sponsored terrorism, warning the international community, It is Pakistan's state-sponsored terrorism which different nations need to understand. Today, we might be the victims of it; tomorrow, the world will be a victim of it. Many nations tell us that India should sit and talk. Who to talk to is the question. Do we talk to the elected government in Pakistan? If there is one? Do we talk to the army there? Do we talk to the Islamic clergy?... His remarks questioned the feasibility of dialogue given Pakistan's internal complexities.Responding to US President Trump's claim of credit for the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, RJD MP Prem Chand Gupta clarified, Who can say what about him? Neither you nor we can. In a situation like this, the world leaders talk to each other. They convey their condolences, they talk, and convey their message... The PakistDGMO called our DGMO and requested a ceasefire, which we accepted in good faith as we want peace... There was no pressure from anyone from anywhere. His comments emphasised that the ceasefire was a bilateral decision aimed at peace.On the firm Indian response to terrorism, Gurdaspur-born Senator from Barcelona, Robert Masih Nahar, praised Operation Sindoor, stating, The government should have done this earlier. We tolerated them for long, we tried to make them understand, but there has to be a day when India had to teach them that it will not tolerate any terrorist attack. It was a good step by India. A terrorist country and those who are running it must get a message that they will get a befitting reply. All the countries are against terrorism. The delegations will talk to the government here, and I think they will get this assurance that Spain is with India. His remarks reflected international support for India's decisive stance against terrorism.In line with this firm stance, the Modi government has undertaken a significant diplomatic outreach following Operation Sindoor by forming seven multi-party delegations. These delegations aim to inform global partners about Pakistan's continued involvement in terrorism and to reinforce India's message of zero tolerance for terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.This diplomatic effort seeks to brief international partners on India's response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, where 26 people were killed by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, and on the broader fight against cross-border terrorism.Launched on May 7, Operation Sindoor was a decisive military action targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. It resulted in the elimination of over 100 terrorists affiliated with terror groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen, underscoring India's resolve to counter terrorism with strong measures.",

        "content": "Two candidates vying to be president vigorously plunge a toilet, kick a football, then pop open a soda -- it can only be South Korean election night, where whacky graphics strive to make vote-counting fun. \"Harry Potter\", \"Squid Game\", a rigorous spinning class... no reference is too small or too bizarre to be mined by broadcaster SBS for outlandish CGI-animated graphics to attract viewers -- and, the journalists behind it say, make politics more accessible and engaging. Thanks to a dozens-strong specialist team at SBS, the dry work of tallying millions of ballots on the evening of June 3, after South Koreans vote for their next leader, will be transformed into an Olympic-level spectacle. \"The pressure is on,\" SBS broadcast journalist Son Hyoung-an, who has been working on the election graphics team since before the poll was announced, told AFP. \"Everyone is asking us what we will do next, and they are excited to see what we'll bring to the table,\" said Son. The tradition began around a decade ago, when South Korean networks noticed they could get more eyeballs on election night by leaning into the country's strong K-pop and K-drama tradition, and by trying to make politics fun and entertaining. It started with simple 2D visuals -- the most striking of which showed candidates walking up a building horizontally -- but, with an enthusiastic response, it has grown in scale and scope. Now, most Korean networks run sophisticated animated sequences that show the candidates' faces and body movements -- with their permission -- using actors to create the movements, then splicing the real faces on top. - Snap election - This year's poll posed a particular challenge, as it is a snap election after ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached and stripped of office over his abortive martial law declaration, meaning that SBS's election team had hardly any time to prepare. \"We need to do five months worth of work in a matter of weeks,\" Son told AFP, adding that convincing the super-busy candidates to spare them a few minutes to film their faces for the graphics was tough. The front-runner, liberal Lee Jae-myung, ran in 2022 and lost to Yoon by the narrowest margin in the country's history -- meaning SBS already had footage of him from their previous coverage. The challenge was with Kim Moon-soo, the conservative former labour minister and ruling People Power Party nominee -- but his team said he was too busy and kept rejecting the election graphics team requests. Eventually, they secured three minutes with him in front of a green screen. Then they just had to come up with the graphics. One of this year's themes is \"Squid Game\", with the animations showing Lee and Kim competing in classic childhood games from the hit Netflix series, from \"red light, green light\" to \"ddakji\". \"Even the smallest ideas are welcome,\" SBS journalist Kim Deok-hyun, told AFP. \"We gather personal memories, joyful moments – anything the team finds entertaining –- without filtering or holding back.\" One team member had a particularly good spinning class and suggested it could work for election night. In the graphic, both candidates' heads bob furiously as they ride indoor bicycles, their vote share rising with each pedal stroke. For voters frustrated by the country's political turmoil, another sequence features a sound effect known in Korean as 'bbeong' -- the noise a fizzy drink makes when opened, or the thwack of a football, or the gurgle when a toilet is unclogged. - Rap battle - SBS is particularly well-known for its election graphics, but all South Korean networks do it -- with one rival channel going viral last year for a rap battle between candidates. \"It does make you wonder, can we go this far with people who might become the president?\" said Kim. But the journalists behind SBS's offerings say that the purpose of the graphics is to create a \"flow\" to engage viewers and keep them hooked on the democratic process. Early in the day while voting is underway, coverage is more restrained, but once exit polls are out \"we'll roll out fast-paced, high-energy items, with rapid-fire summaries to help viewers follow the evolving picture\", said Kim. \"We want people to look forward to our election night coverage, the way they anticipate a new film, thinking, 'I can't wait to see what they do this time'.\" Experts agree that graphics can help keep viewers -- and voters -- engaged. \"Eye-catching graphics could be valuable, if they serve to draw attention not just to visuals but to substantive content that helps elevate the political discourse in our country,\" Kim Seo-joong, a professor at Sungkonghoe University told AFP. hs/ceb/oho/fox",

BJP MP Kangana Ranaut also demanded Panoli's release, emphasizing her apology and democratic rights.",
        "content": "Andhra Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Pawan Kalyan has strongly criticised the West Bengal Police following the arrest of social media influencer Sharmishta Panoli. He said that secularism must be a two-way street and called for fairness in how such cases are handled.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Pawan Kalyan said, During Operation Sindoor, Sharmishta, who is a law student, spoke out. Her words were regrettable and hurt some people. She accepted her mistake, deleted the video, and apologised. The West Bengal Police acted quickly and took action against her. But what about the deep pain caused when elected leaders and MPs from TMC mock Sanatana Dharma? Where is the outrage when our faith is insulted and called 'Gandha Dharm'? Where is their apology? Where is their swift arrest? He added, Blasphemy should always be condemned! Secularism is not a shield for some and a weapon for others. It must work both ways. West Bengal Police, the nation is watching. Please act justly for everyone. Actress and BJP MP Kangana Ranaut also spoke out in support of Sharmishta Panoli. She urged the authorities to release the 22-year-old influencer, who was sent to judicial custody by a Kolkata court after her arrest in Gurugram, Haryana.Kangana said, Harassing someone in the name of law and order is not right. She apologised and deleted the post, yet she is being put in prison, tortured, her career ruined, and her character questioned. This should never happen to any daughter. She added, I urge the West Bengal government not to turn the state into North Korea. Everyone has democratic rights. She has apologised for her comments, which were general and in the kind of language today's generation uses normally, both in English and Hindi. She should be released soon because she is very young and has her whole career and life ahead of her. Sharmishta Panoli, a law student from Pune, Maharashtra, was arrested by Kolkata Police on Friday night from Gurugram. She was produced before the Alipore Court in Kolkata on Saturday, which sent her to judicial custody for 14 days.According to Kolkata Police, several attempts were made to serve legal notices to Panoli and her family, but they could not be reached as they were absconding. Following this, the court issued an arrest warrant, leading to her detention in Gurugram.The police said, This case relates to an Instagram video by Sharmishta Panoli that hurt the religious sentiments of a particular community. An FIR was registered at Garden Reach Police Station. Attempts to serve notice as per the law were unsuccessful as the accused and her family were absconding. Subsequently, a warrant of arrest was issued by the court, based on which she was arrested from Gurugram yesterday. It is important to note that Panoli had deleted the controversial video and apologised on 15 May.",

        "description": "According to the decision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, the paddy minimum support price has been increased to ₹2,369 per quintal from last year’s ₹2,300",
        "content": "The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has condemned the minimum support price (MSP) that was announced for 14 crops for the current kharif season by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on May 28. The government has increased the paddy rate to ₹ 2,369 per quintal (100 kg) from last year’s ₹ 2,300. In a statement, the SKM mentioned, “The MSP is not based on Swaminathan Commission’s recommendation of C2+50% formula. Had it been implemented, the paddy MSP should have been ₹ 3,135 per quintal. The average production in India for paddy is 25-30 quintals per acre and the loss due to non-implementation of Swaminathan Commission’s recommendation for farmers on one-acre production will be in the range of ₹ 19,150 to ₹ 22,980, which is three times higher than ₹ 6,000 being provided under the PM Kisan Nidhi,” the SKM leaders stated. The C2 formula of calculating the cost of cultivation includes the cost of capital and the rent on the land to give farmers 50% returns. A senior SKM leader, Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, said the group and the farmer’s organisations across the country were consistently demanding implementation of the C2+50% formula for MSP with guaranteed procurement as promised in the election manifesto of the BJP in the 2014 general election. “However, the BJP-led Union government under PM Modi has been betraying the farmers for the 12th year by not increasing the MSP using the C2+50% formula,” he said. The SKM added the rate of inflation and the rising prices of fertilisers, seed and other input materials, including petroleum products, and the living cost were much higher than the MSP hike. The SKM has also decided to ensure active participation in a nationwide general strike at tehsil and block level on July 9.",

Reuters confirms the gesture and backlash.",
        "content": "“If it looks like a Nazi salute and smells like a Nazi salute, but one guy’s a tech billionaire and the other is a Democrat senator, only one of them ends up being banned in Berlin.” Welcome to yet another episode of Who Gets Cancelled Today?—where the rules are made up, the outrage is algorithmic, and consistency is strictly optional. Let’s set the stage. In January 2025, at Donald Trump’s second inauguration—a carnival of CPAC cosplay, Mar-a-Lago loyalists, and Liberty University dropouts—Elon Musk stepped on stage, placed his hand over his heart, and extended his arm outward with the ceremonial stiffness of a Leni Riefenstahl extra. Reuters confirms the gesture and backlash. Germany, where the Nazi salute is criminalised when used in ideological contexts, responded with moral indigestion and political outrage. Politicians demanded travel bans. German media erupted. The New York Times ran grim explainer columns. MSNBC activated their \"Rise of Fascism\" chyron package. (No, seriously, they have one.) The Anti-Defamation League, bless their diplomatically exhausted souls, tried to de-escalate: they called it “an awkward gesture made in a moment of enthusiasm.” But that didn't stop former ADL director Abraham Foxman from calling it exactly what it looked like: a Nazi salute. BBC and Haaretz captured the range of reactions. Musk, predictably, memed through the chaos. He dismissed the outrage as “dirty tricks” and said the “‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.” His actual words on X/Twitter. Meanwhile, some far-right Telegram channels threw digital confetti. Fast forward to May 2025. Enter Senator Cory Booker—America’s favourite motivational speaker in a suit. At the California Democratic Convention, Booker made a gesture eerily similar: hand over heart, arm extended outward, open palm. Footage surfaced on social media. Cue: crickets. No Germany. No ADL. No CNN panels dissecting palm angles. No panicked Atlantic thinkpieces. Just a quick clarification from Booker’s spokesperson: “He was waving to the audience.” Case closed. Nothing to see here. Piers Morgan, ever the thundercloud of transatlantic outrage, noticed. He highlighted the double standard and triggered an X-storm. Elon the Meme Lord vs Cory the Choirboy Elon is the algorithm’s favourite villain: a ketamine-fuelled libertarian who co-signed Trump’s chaos and dropped $275 million to support the re-election campaign. He’s what happens when Reddit becomes sentient and buys a stake in SpaceX. So when Musk makes a vaguely Roman gesture? Of course it’s fascism. Throw in some AI-enhanced screenshots and a Daily Show segment, and suddenly it’s 1933 again. Cory Booker, on the other hand, is Progressive America’s wholesome avatar—the kind who quotes Rumi during climate speeches. His identical gesture? A heartwarming wave. If Elon had done it while holding a “Biden 2024” placard, Vox would’ve called it “a subversive reclaiming of classical Americana.” The Outrage Exchange Rate In this economy of curated outrage, Musk trades at Tesla volatility. Every blink is a Bitcoin crash. Booker? He’s a mutual fund of liberal goodwill. You’d need a Wagner soundtrack and SS cosplay before NPR considers it problematic. But here’s the rub: when the rules of moral outrage change depending on the party—or the palm—you can kiss public trust goodbye. Remember when the Left said “symbols matter”? Apparently not when it’s one of their own accidentally doing a salute straight out of Triumph of the Will: The Musical. When Satire Becomes News There’s an old Dr Strangelove scene where the titular character can't stop his arm from flying up in a Nazi salute. That’s what this feels like. Except instead of satire, we now have real-life Democrats doing the salute, Republicans doing the same, and both sides frantically uploading context to cloud drives of morality. The media? Just a referee selectively enforcing the rules. Final Salute So here’s your closing thought: if you’re going to raise your hand in American politics, make sure it’s the correct hand, with the correct party ID, at the correct convention—preferably surrounded by coastal elites and NPR donors. Otherwise, you might find yourself Photoshopped into history’s darkest moments and banned from Bavaria. Because in today’s reality-TV democracy, gestures are never just gestures. Unless, of course, they are.",

        "content": "Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu has already been jailed by Erdogan in March this year on charges of corruption and aiding a terrorist group. Published: June 2, 2025 9:07 AM IST By Joy Pillai | Edited by Joy Pillai Ankara: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is trying to eliminate the opposition and is emerging as the new dictator of the country. As per reports, at the behest of Erdogan, Turkish authorities have detained several members of the opposition party in Istanbul. Several raids were conducted on opposition-run municipalities. According to Turkish media, these raids are part of legal action against the opposition. However, this is being seen as a retaliatory action against the opposition. Erdogan’s Biggest Rival Is Already In Jail Notably, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu has already been jailed by Erdogan in March this year on charges of corruption and aiding a terrorist group. He is also the Turkish President’s political rival and was ahead of him in some polls. The arrest of Ekrem, from the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), sparked widespread protests and economic turmoil. The action also put allegations on government influence on judiciary system. However, the Turkish government has denied this and said that the country’s judiciary is independent. Erdogan Working Against Democracy Critics, including Western nations, human rights organisations, and the CHP, contend that the actions against Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoglu are undemocratic and intended to hinder the opposition’s electoral chances. İmamoglu and the CHP maintain a lack of concrete evidence supporting the charges. Recent polls indicate increased public support for İmamoglu following the arrests, strengthening his lead over President Erdoğan and solidifying his position as a likely key opponent in the 2028 presidential election. Erdogan Is Going To Change The Constitution Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the formation of a legal team to draft a new constitution. While he claims the current constitution is outdated and influenced by the 1980 military coup, critics express concern that the proposed changes could extend his presidency beyond 2028, his current term’s end. Erdogan has held the presidency since 2014. For breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram . Read more on Latest World News on India.com . Topics",

        "content": "Donald Trump’s former “fixer” predicts the president will turn on his richest ally—and he’ll come for Elon Musk’s billions. Michael Cohen, who spent years as Trump’s personal attorney and confidant, told an MSNBC panel Sunday he had long anticipated that the Trump-Musk “bromance was going to come to an end.” “I’m going to say Trump will ultimately go after Elon’s money next, because it bothers him that he is the richest man in the world,” Cohen said on The Weekend: Primetime. “Yes, he used him for his money. Now he’s going to go and he’s going to figure out how Elon, with his companies, took advantage of the United States of America.” Cohen suggested Trump could use the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—which Musk spearheaded until last week—to target the government subsidies that helped build the Tesla founder’s fortune, specifically the electric vehicle tax credit. “They’re going to turn around, use DOGE to go, ‘right, government efficiency, fraud, waste and abuse. How is it that he got $7,000 as a credit for every Tesla vehicle that was sold? That’s where his billions were made. Why should the United States pay for electric vehicles? Pay your own car if that’s what you want.’ So they’re going to claw it back,” Cohen said. “He’s going to do to Elon Musk, my prediction, what Mohammed bin Salman did to the other members of the royal family,” he added, referring to the Saudi Arabian ruler’s 2017 crackdown on wealthy relatives. The White House did not immediately return the Daily Beast’s request for comment. Cohen’s prediction comes amid growing signs of fracture between Trump and Musk, who last week formally ended his time working with the administration at the helm of DOGE. The break followed a stretch in which Musk–a top donor who was allegedly taking drugs on the campaign trail–reportedly clashed with Trump aides and was viewed increasingly as a loose cannon within Trumpworld. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty in 2018 to multiple federal crimes, including campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to Congress. His conviction stemmed in part from orchestrating hush money payments during the 2016 election to silence women who alleged affairs with Trump. He served just over a year behind bars before being released to home confinement in 2020 due to COVID-19 concerns.",

        "content": "Anthony Albanese's government considering a new tax to help Australia achieve its climate targets READ MORE: What other things Jim Chalmers could tax By MAX AITCHISON, POLITICAL REPORTER FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA Published: 04:28, 2 June 2025 | Updated: 04:29, 2 June 2025 e-mail View comments Chris Bowen has refused to rule out a possible 'carbon tariff' on dirty cement or steel as he acknowledged that Australia must 'do more' to achieve its climate targets. The Energy and Climate Change Minister was quizzed by the ABC's David Speers about whether he would bring in a carbon tariff. This would see levies placed on carbon-intensive products such as steel, cement and lime imported from abroad and could make the building process more expensive. It is a way of ensuring that Australian companies do not outsource carbon-emitting activities to other countries with less ambitious carbon-reduction targets. 'We have been clear that we want to ensure Australian industry is best placed to compete in a decarbonising world,' Bowen told the program. 'What could be the case is ... we look at particular sectors first around cement and lime, [which] are places that we looked at in particular, but I'm not going to get in front of the process... 'We'll have more to say during the course of this term.' The Australian Government appointed Professor Frank Jotzo to lead a review into carbon leakage and what policy options were available to address it. Energy and Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen (pictured) was quizzed by the ABC's David Speers about whether he would bring in a carbon tariff - and twice refused to rule it out This would see levies placed on carbon-intensive products such as steel, cement and lime imported from abroad and could make the building process more expensive His preliminary report identified cement, clinker and lime as industries in which there was a high leakage risk, while steel, glass and ammonia posed a moderate risk. The European Union has brought in a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which will imposes a carbon tax on imports from countries with less strict climate policies. Bowen's refusal to rule it out was criticised by the Coalition's new energy spokesperson Dan Tehan. 'Now before the election, Chris Bowen, this arrogant minister, said nothing about carbon tariffs,' he said. 'Yet here he is immediately after the election talking about putting them in place.' Read More Chris Bowen sparks outrage after he is caught eating pasta at Catholic mass: 'Rude' Tehan accused Bowen of putting Australia's 'energy security at risk' and putting gas and electricity prices up. 'Now he wants to follow Donald Trump's lead and put in tariffs. What a mess,' he added. Bowen said Australia was 'by and large on track' to meet its target of reducing emissions by 43 per cent by 2030. This is despite figueres last week showing little progress was made in 2024. 'We've never suggested it's a linear line ... But with the right approach from government, yes, we can continue to be on track (despite) facing headwinds and challenges from time to time,' he said. Labor was criticised by environmental groups for approving a 40-year extended licence to WA's North West Shelf, the largest oil and gas project in the country. The government has a deadline this year to set its 2035 emissions reduction target.

        "content": "Swan Lake isn’t one of those stories that connects hard with current events or the world around it. You can say much the same for ballet itself. As a form, it usually doesn’t have much to say. Ballet Preljocaj’s production, which debuted in France in 2020, is something of an exception to the rule. Making its Australian premiere within days of Woodside receiving the federal government’s (election-delayed) green light to extend the life and colossal climate impact of its North West Shelf gas project until 2070, and the Woodside boss Meg O’Neill’s clumsy attempt to shift responsibility to supposedly Temu-addicted gen Z consumers , this staging from has a bit of a kick to it. A Swan Lake for the ecocide era, if you like. It’s not the first reworking of Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov’s 1895 classic, of course. Choreographers including Alexei Ratmansky, Matthew Bourne (his famous all-male Swan Lake ) and Mats Ek have all ruffled the feathers of this tutu favourite. Here though, Angelin Preljocaj manages to entirely rework the choreography while honouring the narrative spine of the original and some of its structure. He doesn’t throw the cygnets out with the lake water. For music, he draws principally on the Tchaikovsky score (played here in this QPAC exclusive season by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra under the sensitive baton of Johannes Fritzsch) cut with extracts from Tchaikovsky’s Second and Fourth Symphonies and dark-toned slabs of electronica and EDM by the French studio 79D. Fans of the original will not find the story hard to follow. Here, the royal court is dystopian-corporate but the broad sweep of the story still has a young Prince Siegfried (Antoine Dubois on this occasion, alternating the role with Leonardo Cremaschi) chafing against expectation and falling for Odette (Théa Martin/Mirea Delogu), a woman who has been transformed into a swan by the sorcerer Rothbart (Redi Shtylla/Elliot Bussinet). In this version, Rothbart is a rapacious property developer whose city-building scheme is eagerly supported by Siegfried’s wealthy parents, who play a much larger part in the drama than more traditional versions. Siegfried has an exceptionally tender and close relationship with his mother, for example, and his father appears to be in bed (sometimes literally) with Rothbart. Early on, plans for the transformation of the kingdom are waved around in paper form. A trolley is wheeled on bearing an idealised model of the proposed venture. Neither makes a visceral impact, it must be said. Later, however, huge monochromatic digital projections by Boris Labbé start to loom large, filling the space with images of rising city skylines, stock market trends, excavators and, eventually, an industrial plant with a throbbing life of its own – one that spells a grim death for Odette and her swan kind. Preljocaj’s athletic choreography is full of swagger, strength and sass, and does not incorporate any of Petipa’s dreamy original sequences. But, for lovers of Swan Lake, there are plenty of beautiful lines and bird-like movements, particularly in the white swan sections. The women/swans sometimes embody the whole bird stretching their own necks into beautiful arched shapes, and at other times use their arms as swan necks with hands for heads. The high-impact ensemble routines echo some of the set pieces of the Petipa original, including its court scenes. The Dance of the Little Swans gets a winking update with pelvic wiggles and a sharp weaving of the dancers’ arms. Siegfried and Odette deliver an audience-pleasing romantic pas de deux with inventive lifts. There’s no interval between the “white” and “black” acts of the story. Swan Lake plays straight-through for two hours and its 26-strong cast don’t get much downtime. Preljocaj’s choreography looks demanding with its rapid switching between planes, knifing arms and legs and intricate unison work. The women perform barefoot in short, loose dresses; the men wear suits and pumps (with leather trousers for the bad guys). The highly gendered prettiness and prissiness we associate with Swan Lake is rinsed out. Everyone looks strong, athletic and grounded. From the fourth act, a febrile energy starts to take hold, especially when the swans react en masse to Siegfried’s betrayal. The final image is a striking one, as Siegfried searches for the dying Odette among the twitching, writhing bodies of her kind, all poisoned by the obscenely pumping industrial plant that now surrounds them. Rather than leaving you breathless, this bleak ending sucks the air out of you. Swan Lake is performed in the Lyric Theatre, Queensland Performing Arts Centre until 7 June. Watch the production for free on Digital Stage from 6pm, Friday 13 June to 6pm, Sunday 15 June",
